# Chapter 5: The Room Above the Office

Saturday morning arrived humid and bright. I loaded my belongings into the Ford—two duffel bags, a box of books, toiletries, tools. Everything I owned fit in three trips. Mrs. Fletcher watched from the porch, arms crossed.

"Rent's paid through the month. No refunds."

"I know."

"Don't make Sullivan regret hiring you."

"I won't." I started the engine. She didn't wave.

The drive to the office took five minutes. Katie's navy pickup was already parked out front. The room was accessed through external stairs on the side, metal steps leading up to a green door. Katie appeared at the top holding keys.

"You're early."

"Said nine."

"It's eight-forty-five." She unlocked the door. "Come on up."

I climbed the stairs with my first duffel. The door opened into a single room, fifteen by twenty feet. Twin bed frame against one wall, small kitchenette in the corner—hot plate, sink, mini fridge—bathroom door in back. Two windows faced Elm Street, dusty but letting in good light. Wood floors, plaster walls needing paint, ceiling fan. Clean. Simple. Empty.

"Bathroom's through there. Plumbing and electrical work fine." She tested the hot plate. "You'll need dishes, but the basics are here."

I set the duffel down. This was mine for thirty dollars a month. My own space. Better than Fletcher's by every measure.

"It's good. Thank you."

"Don't thank me yet." Katie pulled out a notebook. "I made a list. Curtains, lamp, radio, sheets, towels. The basics."

"I can get those."

"I have extras at home. My mother was a collector—enough linens to outfit a hotel. You'd be helping me clear out storage."

I recognized the offer—kindness packaged as practicality so I wouldn't refuse. Katie was good at that.

"All right. Thank you."

"You're welcome. Now bring up the rest of your stuff. I'll measure the windows."

It took ten minutes to carry everything up. Katie watched me unpack. Work clothes, couple pairs of jeans, three shirts, winter coat. Books I'd read in detention until the covers fell apart. Toiletries. The photo.

Katie noticed when I pulled it from the box—my mother in front of our old house, smiling in a sundress. Young and healthy and alive. Before the cancer.

"Your mother?" Katie asked quietly.

"Yeah."

"She's beautiful. You have her eyes."

I did. Dark and a little too serious. I set the photo on the windowsill, the only decoration in the room.

Katie didn't pity me. She just finished measuring and made notes. "I'll be back this afternoon with what you need. Two o'clock?"

"You don't have to—"

"I want to. There's a difference." She headed for the door. "Get some lunch. See you at two."

She was gone before I could argue. I stood in the empty room and felt something I couldn't name. Relief. Or the beginning of belonging.

Katie returned at two, truck loaded with boxes. Curtains, lamp, radio, sheets, blankets, towels, throw rug. I helped her carry everything up.

"This is too much."

"It's been in our attic two years. My mother bought it on sale and never used it." Katie set down a box of kitchen supplies. "Saving me a trip to the donation bin."

Whether that was true didn't matter. Katie was giving me a way to accept help, and I appreciated it.

We spent the afternoon transforming the room. Katie hung curtains while I made the bed. I set up the lamp on the floor. Katie plugged in the radio, found a station playing Chuck Berry. We worked in comfortable silence.

"Your father know you're doing this?" I asked, spreading the rug.

"I told him I was helping you settle in. He said that was thoughtful." Katie adjusted a curtain rod. "My father believes in making people feel welcome."

"He's a good man."

"He is." Katie's voice softened. "When my mother died, he fell apart. Stopped going to work, stopped eating. Just sat in their bedroom staring at the wall. Beth and I didn't know what to do."

I stopped working and listened. Katie had mentioned her mother's death before, but never like this—never with this kind of raw honesty.

"What brought him back?" I asked.

"Tommy showed up three weeks after the funeral and told my father the crew needed him. Said they didn't know how to finish the job, that Mike was the only one who could make the framing decisions. It wasn't true—Tommy's capable—but it gave my father a reason to get up." Katie moved to the next window. "He started showing up again. The rest came gradually."

"That's when you took over the office work?"

"Yeah. Someone had to manage the business side, and my father couldn't." Katie's tone was matter-of-fact, but I heard the grief. "I'd been accepted to architecture school for that fall. University of Pennsylvania. Full scholarship."

"You didn't go."

"Couldn't. My father needed help and Beth needed someone stable. Architecture school could wait." She tested the curtain rod. "One semester turned into a year, turned into two. Now I'm twenty and the scholarship's gone."

The loss in her voice made my chest ache.

"You could reapply," I said. "Start next year."

"Maybe." Katie didn't sound convinced. "Logically I know they'd be fine without me. But leaving feels like abandoning them."

I understood that—the guilt of wanting something for yourself when people depended on you. Detention had taught me not to want things. Katie had learned the same lesson through grief.

"What would you design?" I asked. "If you went to school."

Katie's face transformed. "Houses that fit the landscape, use natural light, create spaces that make people feel at peace. My mother said a well-designed house should feel like it grew from the ground." She pulled a folded paper from her pocket, revealed a pencil sketch. "Like this."

The drawing showed a low house with big windows, nestled into a hillside, surrounded by trees. Modern and organic, nothing like the ranch houses at the site.

"That's beautiful," I said. "You drew this?"

"Last week. I sketch sometimes at night when I can't sleep." Katie refolded the paper carefully. "Pointless, probably. But it helps."

"It's not pointless. It's a dream."

"Dreams are pointless if you don't pursue them."

"Then pursue it."

Katie looked at me, surprised. "Like you're pursuing yours?"

Fair point. I hadn't let myself dream in over a year. Survival didn't leave room for dreams.

"I don't know what mine are," I admitted. "In detention, you don't think past the next day, the next week, the end of your sentence. Planning for a future they might take away feels stupid. Dangerous, even."

"You're not in detention anymore."

"I know. But the habits stick. Don't plan. Don't hope. Don't want. It's safer."

Katie sat on the edge of the newly made bed, gestured for me to sit beside her. I did, leaving space between us.

"What do you want, Alex? After probation ends, when you're free to go anywhere, do anything—what do you want?"

The question sat heavy in the space between us. No one had asked me that in months. Years, maybe. What did I want?

"To not screw up," I said finally. "To make it through probation clean and prove I'm not the guy who steals cars and disappoints everyone."

"That's avoiding failure, not pursuing success. Different things." Katie's voice was gentle but firm. "Try again. What do you want?"

I looked around the room—curtains filtering afternoon light, my mother's photo on the windowsill, radio playing quiet music, Katie sitting beside me waiting for an honest answer.

"I want to be good at something that matters," I said quietly. "I want to build houses like the ones you draw. I want to learn from Mike until I know the trade inside out. I want people to see my work and know it'll stand for fifty years because I built it right." The words came faster now, truth spilling out. "I want to wake up and not be afraid I'll lose everything before sunset. I want to belong somewhere instead of just passing through. I want to deserve second chances instead of just surviving them."

Katie's hand found mine, squeezed gently. "Those are good wants, Alex. Real ones."

"They scare me."

"Good dreams should. Means they matter." She stood, pulled me up with her. "Now come on. We still need to stock that kitchenette and you need to learn how to work a hot plate without setting off the smoke detector."

We spent the rest of the afternoon making the room livable. Katie showed me the grocery store, helped me buy basics. She taught me to work the temperamental hot plate, labeled radio stations, left magazines she'd finished reading.

By sunset, the room looked like someone lived there. I stood in the doorway after Katie left and looked at what we'd built. This was mine. My space. My fresh start. My chance to prove I could build something good.

The radio played low. Curtains filtered orange sunset light. My mother's photo caught the glow.

For the first time in eighteen months, I let myself believe I might actually make it.
