# Chapter 2: The Probation Talk

The patrol car pulled into the construction site Thursday morning like a promise I'd been waiting for. Black and white with Meadowbrook Police Department on the door, rolling slow across the dirt lot the way cops always drove when they wanted you to know they were watching. My hands kept working, setting the next stud, but my stomach dropped.

Officer Ed Brennan climbed out in full uniform, mirrored sunglasses reflecting June sunlight. He wasn't related to me despite sharing my last name—he'd made that joke grimly during our first meeting. He scanned the site until he spotted me, then gestured toward his car.

First weekly check-in. Right on schedule.

I set down my hammer and walked toward him, aware of every eye on the crew tracking my movement. Tommy paused mid-cut on his circular saw. Ray stopped hauling lumber. Pete and Jim watched from the roof they were framing. Even Mike looked up from the blueprints spread across his truck hood. The ex-con getting called to the patrol car. Exactly what they'd been expecting since I started.

"Brennan." Officer Brennan opened the passenger door. "Get in."

I slid into the front seat. The interior smelled like coffee and vinyl, radio crackling low. Brennan settled behind the wheel and pulled a folder from between the seats. Through the windshield I could see the crew pretending not to watch.

"How's the job?" Brennan asked, flipping open my case file.

"Good. Mike says I'm doing fine work."

"That's what he told me when I called Tuesday." Brennan made a note. "You showing up on time?"

"Yes, sir. Every morning by seven."

"Any problems with the crew?"

"No, sir. They're... they're treating me fair."

Brennan studied me over his sunglasses. Ex-military bearing, missed nothing. "Fair meaning they're giving you a chance or fair meaning they're making your life hell?"

"Giving me a chance."

"Good." Another note. "Let's review the rules. I know you know them, but we're going through them every week until they're carved in your brain."

I nodded. This was the routine. Accountability through repetition.

"No alcohol consumption. Not a beer, not a sip, not even communion wine if you go to church. Zero tolerance. Understood?"

"Yes, sir."

"No associating with known criminals or anyone with a record. That includes old friends from before detention. They call you, you hang up. They show up, you walk away. Clear?"

"Clear."

"Curfew is ten PM every night. You're in your residence by ten, you stay there until six AM. Officer Maloney does random bed checks. He finds you gone, you're back in detention that night."

My chest tightened, but I kept my voice steady. "Understood."

"Weekly check-ins, Thursdays at ten hundred hours. You miss one, I issue a warrant. No exceptions, no excuses. You're sick, you're dying, you're on fire—you call me before ten and we reschedule. Otherwise it's a violation."

"I'll be here."

"No leaving the county without written permission submitted seventy-two hours in advance. That includes day trips, weekend visits, family emergencies. You want to leave Meadowbrook, you ask me first."

"Yes, sir."

Brennan leaned back, sunglasses still on, expression unreadable. "You understand what's at stake here, Brennan. You violate any of these conditions—any of them—and you go back to juvenile detention until you're twenty-one. That's three more years locked up. Three years of your life gone because you couldn't follow simple rules."

Three years. The number lived in my head like a countdown. I'd be twenty-one before I got out again. Twenty-one years old with a record that would follow me everywhere, five years of my life surrendered to concrete and bars and doors I couldn't open.

"I understand, sir."

"Do you? Because a lot of kids your age think they understand, then they make one stupid choice—have one beer, take one joyride, see one old friend—and they're back inside wondering how it happened." Brennan's voice wasn't cruel, just factual. He'd seen this story before. "I don't want you to be that kid, Alex. I got you this job because I think you've got a shot at making something of yourself. But only if you take it seriously."

"I am taking it seriously."

"Then prove it. Every single day. Show up, work hard, follow the rules, stay out of trouble. Eighteen months from now you walk away clean with a trade skill and a reference from Mike Sullivan. That's worth more than you know."

Eighteen months. Five hundred forty-seven days when I'd checked this morning. It felt impossible and too close at the same time.

"Yes, sir."

Brennan closed the folder. "How's the boarding house?"

"Fine."

"Mrs. Fletcher treating you all right?"

"She watches me like I'm gonna steal the silverware, but yeah, it's fine."

A ghost of a smile crossed Brennan's face. "Dorothy Fletcher's been renting rooms for thirty years. She watches everyone like that. Don't take it personal." He tucked the folder away. "You need anything—problems at work, issues with housing, anything that might become a problem—you call me. I'd rather help you solve it before it turns into a violation."

"Thank you, sir."

"Next check-in is Thursday, same time. Don't be late." Brennan started the engine, dismissal clear.

I climbed out of the patrol car and walked back toward the construction site, every step feeling like the crew was measuring my stride, reading my expression, deciding what kind of guy I was based on a ten-minute conversation with my probation officer. The ex-con. The kid one violation away from going back inside.

Mike met me halfway, thumbs hooked in his belt, expression calm. "Everything square with Brennan?"

"Yes, sir. Just weekly check-in."

"Good." Mike fell into step beside me. "Crew knows about your record, Alex. I told them when I hired you—full disclosure. I don't keep secrets from my guys."

My jaw tightened. "What'd you tell them?"

"That you did time for car theft, you're on probation, and you're getting a second chance. I also told them to judge you on your work, not your past." Mike stopped, turned to face me. "My brother Jack went to prison for armed robbery back in '37. Served ten years. Everyone said he'd end up dead or back inside within a year of release. He proved them wrong. Owns a garage in Pittsburgh now, been clean twenty years. So I know what a second chance can mean if a man takes it seriously."

I didn't know what to say to that. Mike Sullivan's brother was a felon. The boss who'd hired me understood.

"Thank you for the chance."

"Don't thank me. Earn it." Mike's tone was firm but not unkind. "Work hard, stay honest, prove you belong here. That's how you thank me."

"Yes, sir."

We returned to the framing work. Tommy handed me the hammer I'd set down, his expression unreadable. I waited for the questions, the judgment, the distance. Instead, Tommy measured the next board and marked the cut.

"Car theft, huh?"

Here it was. I kept my voice flat, factual. "Yeah."

"You boost it yourself or run with a crew?"

"Crew. They ran when cops showed up. I didn't."

Tommy made the cut, tested the fit. "That's the thing about crews. Everybody's brothers until the handcuffs come out." He positioned the board. "Hold this steady."

I held it. Tommy nailed it in place, checked the level, moved to the next one. That was it. No sermon, no suspicion, just acknowledgment and moving on. The simplicity of it made my throat tight.

"Thanks," I said.

"For what?"

"Not making it a thing."

Tommy shrugged. "We all got pasts. What matters is whether you're pulling your weight today." He handed me the nail gun. "Finish this wall. I'm gonna grab lunch from Callahan's. You want anything?"

I still had my packed sandwich, but the invitation mattered more than food. "I'm good."

"Suit yourself."

Lunch break came at noon. The crew scattered—Tommy and Ray driving to Callahan's Diner, Pete and Jim eating in the shade of the half-built house, Mike heading to the office trailer to return phone calls. I sat on a stack of plywood with my sandwich and thermos of water, letting the routine settle over me like a familiar coat. This was my life now. Construction site lunches, sawdust in my hair, sun beating down on my neck. Honest work.

Katie's pickup pulled in just after twelve-thirty, bed loaded with brown paper bags from Callahan's. She distributed them to the crew—Tommy and Ray had ordered ahead, apparently. She handed me a Coca-Cola bottle without asking, condensation beading cold on the glass.

"Didn't order anything," I said.

"I know. Thought you might want something cold." She sat down on the plywood next to me, pulled out her own lunch. "How'd your check-in go?"

"You knew about that?"

"Patrol car at a construction site isn't subtle." Katie unwrapped her sandwich. "My father mentioned you'd have weekly meetings with your probation officer. That why Brennan came by?"

"Yeah. Making sure I'm following the rules."

"Are you?"

The question was direct but not accusatory. I met her eyes. "Yes."

"Then you've got nothing to worry about." Katie took a bite, matter-of-fact. "People in small towns talk, Alex. They're going to have opinions about you being here, about your record, about my father hiring someone on probation. Best thing you can do is ignore it and keep doing good work."

"That what you do?"

"What do you mean?"

"Ignore what people say about you."

Katie paused, considering. "People said plenty when my mother died and I took over managing the business side. Wondered if I was capable, if my father was making a mistake trusting me, if I should be in college instead of running supply orders. I proved them wrong by being better at the job than they expected."

"You think I can prove them wrong?"

"I think you already are." Katie gestured at the framed walls rising around us. "Tommy says you're a fast learner and your work is solid. That's proof. Everything else is just noise."

The Coca-Cola was cold and sweet, cutting through sawdust and heat. Katie ate her sandwich in comfortable silence, reviewing her schedule clipboard. She didn't treat me like I was fragile or damaged or one wrong move from disaster. She treated me like a worker on her father's crew who'd earned a cold drink on a hot day.

It was the first time since getting out that I felt something close to normal.

"Thank you," I said. "For the Coke."

Katie smiled, the real kind that reached her eyes. "You're welcome. Now finish your lunch. Afternoon's going to be brutal in this heat."

She was right about that. But for the first time in eighteen months, brutal heat and hard work sounded pretty damn good.
