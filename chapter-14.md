# Chapter 14: Beth's Warning

Beth cornered me late Thursday afternoon at the construction site. Katie had driven to Johnson's Lumber Yard to pick up an order. The crew was framing the fourth house. I was working alone on cabinet installation in house three when Beth's voice cut through my concentration.

"We need to talk."

I looked up. Beth stood in the unfinished kitchen doorway, arms crossed, expression hard. Seventeen years old and fierce with protective fury. She'd clearly been waiting for this opportunity—Katie gone, me isolated, chance to speak without interference.

"About what?"

"About my sister." Beth stepped into the room, planted herself where I couldn't ignore her. "About your intentions."

The old-fashioned phrasing would have been funny if her expression wasn't deadly serious. I set down my drill.

"I'm not sure what you mean."

"Don't play dumb. You and Katie. Everyone sees it. The way you look at each other. The coffee every morning. Staying late together. The town dance. Last night in the office." Beth's voice was sharp. "So I'm asking directly: what are your intentions?"

The question deserved honesty but I didn't have an honest answer. I didn't know my own intentions. I just knew I cared about Katie more than was smart and I was terrified of hurting her.

"I care about your sister."

"That's not an answer." Beth moved closer, relentless. "Are you staying in Meadowbrook after probation ends? Building a life here? Or are you killing time until you can leave?"

"I don't know."

"You don't know." Beth's laugh was bitter. "Katie is falling for you. Everyone can see it. My father sees it. The crew sees it. Mrs. Callahan mentioned it to me at the diner yesterday. And you don't know if you're staying?"

"Probation doesn't end for eighteen more months. A lot can change—"

"Exactly. A lot can change. You could decide Meadowbrook isn't for you. You could violate probation and go back to detention. You could meet your requirement and leave for somewhere with no judgment and no ex-con stigma." Beth's voice turned fierce. "Katie has been through enough. She lost our mother. She gave up architecture school. She's spent two years holding our family together. She doesn't need someone using her for eighteen months then disappearing."

The accusation stung. "I'm not using Katie."

"Then what ARE you doing? Because from where I stand, you're getting close to my sister without any plan for the future. You're letting her care about you without knowing if you'll stay. That's using her even if you don't mean to."

I had no answer. Beth was right. I was falling for Katie without knowing my own future, without being able to promise I'd stay, without deserving her in the first place.

"I care about her," I said quietly. "More than is probably smart. But I don't know what I can promise. My whole life right now depends on not violating probation. One mistake and I lose everything."

"Then maybe you should leave now. Before she's in too deep. Before you break her heart along with everything else she's lost."

Beth's words landed like blows. Leave now to protect Katie from eventual hurt. The logic was sound and devastating.

"Katie deserves someone who'll stay," Beth continued. "Someone who can build a life here. Get married. Have a family. Put down roots. Not someone who might disappear in eighteen months or eighteen weeks if probation doesn't work out."

"What if I want to be that person?"

"Wanting isn't enough. My mother wanted to survive cancer. Katie wanted to go to architecture school. I wanted our family to stay whole. Wanting doesn't make things happen." Beth's voice cracked slightly. "Katie deserves certainty. Stability. Someone all-in, not someone keeping one foot out the door."

The pain in her voice made me see Beth differently. Not just hostile younger sister but grieving daughter who'd lost her mother and refused to watch her sister get hurt too. Beth's protectiveness came from love and fear in equal measure.

"I don't want to hurt her."

"Then don't. Make a decision. Stay and commit or leave before she's too attached." Beth headed for the door, paused. "Katie sees the good in you. She always sees the good in people. But good intentions don't protect people from heartbreak. Actions do."

She left, footsteps echoing across the unfinished house. I stood in the empty kitchen with my drill and cabinet parts and Beth's words ringing in my ears.

Was I staying or leaving? Did I deserve Katie or was Beth right that I was using her? Could I promise a future when I didn't even know if I'd make it through probation?

That evening Katie showed up at the construction site as usual, carrying Cokes and her easy smile. But when she walked toward me I felt Beth's words like a wall between us.

"Hey. Thought you might still be here." Katie held out the Coke. "Working late again?"

"Just finishing up." I took the Coke, didn't meet her eyes.

"You okay? You seem off."

"I'm fine."

Katie studied me with that direct gaze that saw too much. "What happened? Did something go wrong with the cabinets?"

"No. The cabinets are fine." I set down the Coke, forced myself to look at her. "Beth came by earlier."

Understanding flickered across Katie's face. "She talked to you."

"Yeah."

"What did she say?"

"She asked about my intentions. Whether I'm staying or leaving after probation."

Katie's expression was carefully neutral. "What did you tell her?"

"That I don't know."

Silence settled between us, heavy and uncomfortable. Katie looked at the Coke in her hand, at the unfinished kitchen, anywhere but at me.

"Maybe Beth's right," I said quietly. "Maybe we should keep things professional. Boss's daughter and employee. Nothing more complicated than that."

Katie's head snapped up. "Is that what you want?"

No. I wanted morning coffee and evening Cokes and Katie's hand in mine and the possibility of building something real. But Beth's questions echoed: could I promise to stay? Could I offer Katie certainty? Could I be what she deserved instead of just what she wanted?

"I think it's smarter," I said instead of the truth.

"Smarter." Katie's voice went flat. "What changed between last night and now? Yesterday you told me you wanted me. Today you want professional distance. What happened?"

"Beth made me think about what I can actually offer. And the answer is not much. I'm on probation for eighteen more months. I have no idea where I'll be or what I'll be doing after that. I can't promise you anything."

"I didn't ask for promises."

"But you deserve them. You deserve someone who's staying, building a life here, all-in." I picked up my drill, needed something to do with my hands. "I can't be that person. Not yet. Maybe not ever."

Katie set down her Coke very carefully. "You're scared. Beth got in your head and now you're running. That's what this is."

She was right. But admitting it felt too vulnerable.

"I'm being realistic."

"You're being a coward." Katie's voice turned sharp. "Yesterday you were brave enough to admit what you wanted. Today you're pulling back because someone questioned whether you deserve it. That's not realistic, Alex. That's fear."

"Maybe fear is realistic when you've already lost everything once."

The words came out harsh. Katie flinched but held her ground.

"Fine. You want professional distance? We'll be professional." She grabbed her Coke, headed for the door. "See you Monday morning. For work."

She was gone before I could respond. I stood in the empty kitchen listening to her truck start, drive away, disappear. The Coke she'd brought me sat on the workbench, condensation forming on the glass.

I'd done the right thing. Protected Katie from eventual hurt. Pulled back before she was too invested. Listened to Beth's warning before someone got devastated.

But watching Katie drive away with hurt in her eyes felt like the worst kind of wrong.

I gathered my tools in the growing darkness, thinking about Beth's questions and Katie's hurt and my own cowardice. Because Katie was right. I was running. Beth had questioned whether I deserved her sister and I'd immediately proven I didn't by choosing fear over fight.

The construction site felt lonely without Katie's presence. The houses I was building seemed pointless. The future I'd started imagining—contractor's license, staying in Meadowbrook, building a life with Katie—felt impossible.

I drove back to my room thinking about the space I'd just created between Katie and me. Professional distance. Safer. Smarter. Less vulnerable.

Also miserable.

But maybe miserable was what I deserved. Maybe Beth was right that wanting Katie without being able to promise her anything was selfish. Maybe pulling back now would hurt less than inevitable disaster later.

I hung up my work clothes and lay awake seeing Katie's hurt expression, hearing her call me a coward, feeling the truth of it settle in my chest like a weight.

I'd told Katie I wanted her. Less than twenty-four hours later I'd taken it back out of fear. No wonder she was hurt. No wonder Beth didn't trust me.

I didn't trust myself.

Tomorrow I'd show up for work, keep professional distance, prove to Beth and Katie and myself that I could do the right thing even when it felt terrible.

Tomorrow I'd start building walls instead of bridges.

Starting tomorrow.
