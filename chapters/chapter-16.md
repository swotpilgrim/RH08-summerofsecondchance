# Chapter 16: Midpoint - The Accusation

I knew something was wrong the moment I pulled up to the site Monday morning. Mike's truck sat at an angle like he'd arrived in a hurry, and Tommy stood beside the tool shed shaking his head.

My stomach dropped. Not again.

"What happened?" I asked, climbing out.

Tommy's expression held something I didn't like. Wariness. "More tools missing. Mike's doing inventory."

The words hit like a fist to the chest. Of course. Because I'd never escape being the obvious suspect.

I followed Tommy to the tool shed, where Mike was checking items against a clipboard, his jaw set in a tight line. Ray stood nearby, arms crossed, watching. The other crew members—Pete, Joe, and Carl—were clustered together by their trucks, speaking in low voices that stopped when they saw me.

"Morning, Alex," Mike said without looking up from the clipboard.

"Morning." My voice came out rougher than I intended. "What's missing?"

"Nail gun. The good level—the Stabila I just bought last month. Couple boxes of finish nails. Hand saw." Mike's pencil tapped against the clipboard. "That's about two hundred dollars' worth of equipment gone since Friday."

Two hundred dollars. I felt sick. I'd made maybe thirty dollars last week after Mrs. Fletcher took out room and board.

"Lock wasn't forced," Ray observed, his voice carrying across the job site. "Whoever took them had a key."

Every head turned toward the tool shed. The padlock hung open on its hasp, intact and undamaged. My hands started to sweat.

"Let's not jump to conclusions," Mike said, but his tone was heavy. Tired. "Could be someone forgot to lock up Friday."

"It was locked when I left," Tommy said. "I checked it myself."

"Me too," Pete added.

The silence that followed felt like a weight pressing down on my chest. I could feel their eyes on me, assessing, calculating. The ex-con. The kid with a record. The one who needed this job to stay out of detention.

Mike set down the clipboard and looked at all of us—really looked, like he was trying to see into our heads. "All right, everybody listen up. We've got a problem here, and I'm only going to say this once."

We gathered around him in the morning light, six men in work boots and jeans, and I'd never felt more separate from them than I did right then.

"Someone is stealing from this crew," Mike said, his voice flat and hard. "Tools are expensive. These losses hurt the business. But more than that, they hurt us." He tapped his chest. "This is about trust. When you work on a crew, you trust the men beside you. You trust them to do their job, to have your back, to be honest."

Ray nodded along like he was in church. I kept my face blank, my hands shoved in my pockets so nobody would see them shaking.

"So I'm asking now," Mike continued. "If someone here made a mistake—if you needed money and took something you shouldn't have—now's the time to come forward. We'll work something out. But if this continues, I'm going to have to take stronger measures."

The silence stretched out like taffy. A crow called from somewhere beyond the job site. A car passed on the road, its engine fading into the distance.

Nobody said a word.

Mike's shoulders sagged slightly, and I saw real disappointment cross his face. "All right then. Back to work. But I'm telling you now—this stops. Whoever's doing this, it stops today."

"Wait." Ray stepped forward, and my stomach clenched. "I got an idea. If we want to clear the air, why don't we search everyone's vehicles? Right now, all of us. That way there's no suspicion, no wondering. We all know we're clean."

My heart started hammering against my ribs.

"I don't know if that's necessary—" Mike began.

"I'll go first," Ray said, already walking toward his truck. "Got nothing to hide."

Tommy shot me a look, quick and worried, but he nodded. "Yeah, all right. Fair enough."

One by one, the crew agreed. What choice did they have? Refusing would look guilty.

"Alex?" Mike asked, his tone careful.

I wanted to run. Wanted to get in my truck and drive until Meadowbrook was a speck in the rearview mirror. But running would prove them all right, wouldn't it?

"Fine," I said. "Search my truck."

We went through the vehicles one by one. Ray's truck, Tommy's, the others—nothing. Then mine.

I opened the truck bed myself, stepping back. Scrap lumber. An old blanket. My basic toolbox. Everything I owned fit in this truck and it still looked empty.

Mike checked under the seat, the glove box. License. Registration. Two dollars in change.

"Nothing here," he said finally.

I should've felt relieved. Instead, I felt hollowed out.

"What about his room?" Ray asked.

The world tilted.

"His room?" Mike turned to look at Ray.

"He's got that room above the construction office, right? Where he's staying?" Ray's expression was helpful, concerned. "I mean, if we're clearing the air, might as well be thorough."

I couldn't breathe. If someone had planted tools in my room—if this was a setup—I was done. Probation violation. Straight back to detention. Officer Brennan's warning echoed in my head: *one violation and you're back inside until twenty-one.*

"I don't think—" Tommy started.

"It's fine," I heard myself say. My voice sounded like it was coming from very far away. "Search the room."

Mike looked at me for a long moment, and I saw something in his eyes I couldn't read. Regret, maybe. Or pity.

"All right," he said quietly. "Let's get this over with."

---

The room above the construction office wasn't much. Four walls, a bed, a dresser, a hot plate. I'd been living here three months and it still looked temporary. Because part of me had never really believed I'd stay.

Mike went through it while the crew waited outside. I stood in the doorway watching him open drawers. Three shirts. Two pairs of jeans. Work clothes. Everything I owned could fit in a duffel bag.

Under the bed—nothing but dust. The closet—my jacket, boots, a box with my release papers and probation documents.

"There's nothing here," Mike said quietly.

"I know." My throat felt tight.

"I didn't think there would be."

That almost made it worse—that he'd looked anyway.

We went back downstairs together. The crew was waiting, and the look on their faces when Mike shook his head told me everything. Relief from Tommy. Disappointment from Ray, quickly masked. Uncertainty from the others.

"Nothing," Mike announced. "All right, that's it. Everyone's cleared. Now let's get to work."

But nobody moved. We all stood there in the morning sun, and the air felt different now. Thinner. Harder to breathe.

"Mike," I said. My voice came out steady, which surprised me. "Maybe I should quit."

"What?" Mike's head snapped toward me.

"Having me on the crew is causing problems." I kept my eyes on the dirt at my feet. "Tools go missing, everyone looks at me first. That's not fair to you or the business."

"We looked," Mike said. "You're cleared."

"This time." I finally looked up at him. "But next time something goes wrong—and there's always a next time—I'll be the first suspect again. I'll always be the first suspect. That's just how it is."

I could see him wanting to argue, but what was he going to say? That I was wrong? We both knew I wasn't.

"I'm not firing you without proof," Mike said finally. "And I'm not accepting your resignation based on speculation."

"But—"

"End of discussion, Alex." His tone went hard—not angry, but final. "You're part of this crew. That doesn't change because someone's got sticky fingers and no conscience."

Ray shifted his weight, and I caught the movement out of the corner of my eye.

"Now everybody get to work," Mike said. "We've got three houses to finish, and standing around pointing fingers doesn't frame walls or hang drywall."

The crew dispersed slowly. Tommy clapped me on the shoulder as he passed—a quick gesture of solidarity that made my chest ache. The others avoided my eyes.

I grabbed my tool belt and headed toward the house where I'd been working on trim. The nail gun was gone—the one Mike said was missing. I'd have to do the crown molding by hand now. Each nail placed and set individually.

I picked up my hammer and climbed the ladder. Through the window, I could see Katie's truck pulling in. I turned away before she could see me.

I set a nail against the molding and brought the hammer down clean. The nail sank home. I set another. And another.

One nail at a time. One day at a time.

The worst part wasn't that they'd searched. The worst part was knowing they'd search again next time. And the time after that.

Because once you're the ex-con, you're always the ex-con. Even when you're cleared, you're not really clear.

I worked through lunch, through the afternoon, through the careful distance of the crew. By the time Mike called it a day, I'd finished two rooms. My shoulders ached, but the work was good.

I packed up slowly, giving everyone else time to leave first.

When I finally made it to the Ford, Katie was leaning against it.

"You've been avoiding me," she said.

"Had work to do."

"Tommy told me about the tools. About the search."

Of course. Small crew, smaller town.

"They didn't find anything," I said. "Case closed."

"But it's not closed, is it?" Her voice was soft. "Not for you."

I gripped the door handle hard. "Katie, I can't do this right now."

"Pretend it doesn't matter? Pretend you'll ever be anything other than the first guy they suspect?"

"So what are you going to do?" she asked. "Quit? Run?"

I turned around. "They searched my room, Katie. Went through my things looking for stolen tools."

"My father said he didn't think you took them."

"But he looked anyway." The words came out harsh. "And he'll look again next time. Because that's what I am to people—someone who needs to be watched."

Katie stepped closer, eyes fierce. "No. That's what you're deciding to be. You're deciding that one search defines you instead of nine months of good work."

"You don't understand—"

"I understand you're giving up," she said. "And I didn't think you were the kind of person who gave up."

She walked away before I could answer, leaving me beside my truck with sunset turning the sky orange and the taste of defeat bitter in my mouth.

Maybe she was right.

Maybe I was giving up.

But when the world keeps telling you you're guilty, eventually you start believing it.

Even when you're not.
