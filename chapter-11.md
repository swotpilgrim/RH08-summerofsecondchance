# Chapter 11: Monday Morning Reality

I arrived at the construction site before sunrise Monday morning, needing to work through what had happened Saturday night. The almost-kiss. Katie's hand in mine. Pulling back when I should have leaned in. The whole thing played on repeat in my head.

I unlocked the office and made coffee using Katie's setup—grounds in the percolator, water to the line, heat on medium. The familiar motions settled my nerves. By the time the coffee finished brewing, gray dawn had broken over the framed houses.

I poured a cup and sat on the office steps watching light change the sky from gray to pink to blue. Summer birds started singing. The construction site looked peaceful in morning quiet—no hammers, no saws, just potential waiting to be realized.

"You're here early."

Katie's voice made me turn. She stood by her truck in jeans and work shirt, hair pulled back, carrying her clipboard. Looking exactly like herself and somehow entirely different after Saturday night.

"Couldn't sleep," I said.

"Me either." Katie climbed the steps, sat beside me. "Coffee?"

"Just made it."

I poured her a cup. We sat in silence watching the sun rise over partially framed houses. The quiet felt comfortable but charged—awareness of what had almost happened and what still might.

"Saturday was nice," Katie said finally.

"Yeah. It was."

"I'm glad we went."

"Me too."

The conversation felt careful, both of us avoiding the real topic. The almost-kiss hung between us unspoken. Katie sipped her coffee, stared straight ahead.

"We don't have to make this weird," she said quietly. "We're still us. Still working together. Nothing has to change if you don't want it to."

The offering felt generous. Permission to pretend Saturday night hadn't shifted everything. But I couldn't pretend. Didn't want to.

"What if I want it to change?"

Katie looked at me, expression unreadable. "Then it can change. At whatever pace you need."

Before I could respond, Tommy's Chevy rumbled into the lot. The crew was arriving. The workday beginning. Reality reasserting itself.

Tommy climbed out of his truck and spotted us on the office steps. His expression turned knowing—that Italian-American directness that saw everything.

"Morning," he called. "Nice dance Saturday?"

"It was good," Katie said evenly. "Thanks for asking."

Ray pulled up next, followed by Pete and Jim. The crew assembled at the site, collecting tools, reviewing the day's work. Ray approached with his usual greeting, but something in his voice felt off.

"Alex. Heard you took Katie to the dance."

"Yeah."

"Whole town's talking about it." Ray's tone wasn't hostile exactly, but not friendly either. "Boss's daughter and the new guy."

"Ray," Tommy warned.

"Just making conversation." Ray grabbed his toolbox. "People are gonna have opinions, that's all."

He walked away before I could respond. Katie's jaw tightened.

"Ignore him. Ray's protective. He'll get over it."

Mike appeared from his truck, coffee cup in hand. He surveyed the crew, landed on Katie and me still sitting on the office steps.

"Morning. Alex, Katie—I need you two to run to Johnson's Lumber Yard. We're short on two-by-sixes for the next phase. Katie has the order list."

"Sure thing," Katie said.

We climbed into Katie's truck—me passenger, her driving. The cab felt small and immediate. I could smell her shampoo, see her hands on the steering wheel, feel the charged silence between us.

Johnson's Lumber Yard sat fifteen minutes outside town on Route 9. We drove in careful quiet, both hyper-aware of proximity and unspoken tension.

"My father knows," Katie said suddenly. "About the dance. About us."

"He didn't seem upset."

"He's not. He likes you. Trusts you." Katie glanced over. "He told me this morning to invite you to Sunday dinner again this week. Said you're good for me."

The words made something warm bloom in my chest. Mike approved. Mike, whose opinion mattered more than the entire town's judgment.

"What about Beth?"

"Beth will come around. Or she won't. Either way, it's not her decision." Katie's voice was firm. "I'm not letting my sister's fears dictate my life."

Johnson's Lumber Yard sprawled across five acres—stacks of lumber organized by size, hardware section, loading dock. Mr. Johnson ran it with his two sons. We parked by the office and headed inside.

Mr. Johnson looked up from his desk when we entered—sixties, weathered, the kind of guy who'd spent forty years selling lumber and knew everyone's business.

"Katie Sullivan. What can I do for you?"

"Need two-by-sixes. Forty pieces, twelve-foot lengths. My father called it in this morning."

"Right. Got it ready to load." Mr. Johnson glanced at me, recognition flickering. "This the guy you brought to the dance Saturday?"

Katie's expression cooled. "This is Alex Brennan. He works for Sullivan Construction."

"Yeah. Heard about that. Your father's project." The way he said project made it clear he meant charity case. "Mike always was soft-hearted about giving people chances."

The words stung. Not because they were wrong—Mike had taken a chance on me—but because Mr. Johnson made it sound like pity, not opportunity.

Katie's voice turned ice-cold. "Alex is a valued employee. His framing work is excellent and my father trusts him with technical details most guys don't learn for years. Sullivan Construction does business with vendors who respect our crew. If that's a problem, we can take our orders elsewhere."

Mr. Johnson blinked, clearly not expecting Katie's sharp response. "No problem. Just making conversation."

"Good. We'll load the lumber and be on our way."

We walked to the loading dock in tense silence. Mr. Johnson's sons helped us load the two-by-sixes into Katie's truck bed. Forty pieces, twelve feet each, stacked and secured. The whole time Mr. Johnson watched from his office window.

When we were loaded Katie signed the invoice without pleasantries and climbed into the truck. I got in beside her. She started the engine and pulled out of the lumber yard with controlled precision.

"Thank you," I said quietly. "For what you said in there."

"I wasn't defending you. I was stating facts." Katie's hands were tight on the steering wheel. "You're good at your job. My father respects you. The crew respects you. Mr. Johnson's opinion doesn't matter."

"It matters that you said it."

Katie glanced over, expression softening. "He was out of line. You're not my father's project. You're his employee, and a damn good one."

"People are going to talk. About us. About you being with—"

"With what? With you?" Katie's voice turned sharp again. "I don't care what people think, Alex. I've told you that. Mr. Johnson can gossip all he wants. So can Ray and Mrs. Callahan and the entire town. It doesn't change anything."

"It changes how they see you."

"Then they're not really seeing me." Katie pulled onto Route 9, headed back toward Meadowbrook. "My whole life people have had opinions about what I should do. After my mother died everyone had advice—give up architecture school, stay home, take care of my father, don't be selfish. Like wanting something for myself made me a bad daughter."

"You're not selfish."

"I know. But people's opinions made me feel like I was. So I gave up what I wanted to meet everyone's expectations." Katie's voice was fierce now. "I'm done doing that. I like you. I want to spend time with you. If that bothers people, that's their problem."

The conviction in her voice made my chest tight. Katie Sullivan was choosing me despite the gossip, despite the judgment, despite every logical reason to keep distance.

"I'm in too deep," I said quietly.

"What?"

"With you. I'm in too deep and I can't pull back even though I know I should."

Katie pulled the truck onto the shoulder of Route 9 and stopped. She turned to face me, expression serious.

"Why should you pull back?"

"Because I'm on probation. Because your father's my boss. Because the whole town's watching waiting for me to screw up. Because you deserve—"

Katie reached across the cab and took my hand. "Stop telling me what I deserve. I get to decide that. And I've decided I want to know you better. I want to go to more dances. I want to have coffee in the mornings and talk about architecture and carpentry and everything else. I want to see where this goes."

"What if I disappoint you?"

"Then you disappoint me and we deal with it. That's life." Katie squeezed my hand. "But don't disappoint yourself by being too afraid to try."

We sat on the shoulder of Route 9 holding hands in the truck cab with forty two-by-sixes stacked in back and the whole summer day stretching ahead. I looked at Katie Sullivan—determined, honest, brave enough to want things despite the risk—and knew I'd already fallen.

"Okay," I said.

"Okay what?"

"Okay let's see where this goes. No more pulling back."

Katie smiled, the real kind that reached her eyes. "Good."

She pulled back onto Route 9 and we drove toward Meadowbrook with morning sun warming the truck cab and our hands still clasped across the bench seat. I didn't know if this would work. Didn't know if I could be what Katie needed or if the town's judgment would wear us down or if my probation status would make everything impossible.

But for the first time since getting out of detention, I was choosing to want something good. Choosing to stay instead of run. Choosing Katie despite the fear.

Tommy's words from Friday night came back: *stop overthinking and just be happy*.

Maybe I could learn that. Maybe happiness was like carpentry—practice and precision and believing the work would hold.

Maybe Katie Sullivan was teaching me how to build something real.

We pulled into the construction site with lumber loaded and crew already working. Mike appeared to help us unload. Tommy gave me a knowing look. Ray watched with his odd tension. The workday continued like normal.

But everything had changed. Katie and I weren't hiding anymore. We were seeing where this went. Together.

And that terrified and thrilled me in equal measure.
