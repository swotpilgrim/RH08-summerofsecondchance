# Chapter 8: The Crew's Acceptance

Friday afternoon Tommy caught me as we were loading tools into the truck. The rest of the crew had already left, trucks rumbling down the dirt road toward the weekend. He leaned against his Chevy's tailgate, casual but purposeful.

"You got plans tonight?"

"Not really." I secured a toolbox in the Ford's bed.

"Few of the guys are meeting up for beers. You should come."

The invitation landed awkward. I straightened, met his eyes. "I appreciate it, but I can't. Probation."

Tommy's expression shifted—not pity exactly, but understanding. "Right. Forgot about that." He paused, recalibrated. "What about coffee? No law against coffee, is there?"

"No."

"Good. Meet me at Callahan's in an hour. We'll grab a booth, talk shop." Tommy climbed into his truck before I could decline. "See you there."

He drove off, leaving me standing in dust and fading sunlight wondering what I'd just agreed to. Coffee with Tommy felt like it meant something. The crew had been warming to me—nods of approval when I got joints square, Ray asking my opinion on cuts—but this was different. This was friendship, or the start of it.

An hour later I parked outside Callahan's. Through the window I could see Tommy already seated in a corner booth, coffee cup in front of him. I walked in to the familiar bell chime and coffee smell. Mrs. Callahan looked up from behind the counter.

"Alex. Coffee?"

"Please."

"Tommy's booth. I'll bring it over."

I slid into the booth across from Tommy. He was studying me with that direct Italian-American intensity that didn't leave room for deflection.

"Thanks for coming."

"Thanks for inviting me."

Mrs. Callahan appeared with coffee, set it down, disappeared without small talk. I added sugar and cream, buying time.

"You've been with Sullivan Construction almost a month now," Tommy said. "Doing good work. Better than good—real talent for the trade."

"Thank you."

"Mike's impressed. Doesn't say it out loud much, but I can tell. The way he trusts you with detail work, lets you frame independently. That's respect."

I sipped coffee. This felt like preamble to something bigger.

"The crew likes you too," Tommy continued. "Ray said yesterday you've got the best eye for plumb he's seen in a new guy. Pete thinks you should apprentice for contractor's license. Even Jim's coming around and he doesn't like anybody."

"That's good to hear."

"So." Tommy leaned forward. "What's going on with you and Katie?"

The question hit direct, no warning. I set down my cup carefully. "Nothing's going on."

"Alex. I've known Katie since she was twelve. I've worked for Mike ten years. I see how she looks at you. How you look at her when you think nobody's watching."

"There's nothing—"

"Don't lie to me." Tommy's tone stayed friendly but firm. "I'm not asking to cause trouble. I'm asking because Katie's like family to me. Her mother's death nearly destroyed them all. Katie held that family together when she should've been at college. She deserves to be happy. So I'm asking: what's going on?"

The honesty in his voice made deflection feel cheap. I met his eyes.

"Nothing's going on because nothing can go on. I'm an ex-con on probation working for her father. She deserves better than that."

"Better how?"

"Better than someone with a record. Someone the whole town whispers about. Someone who might screw up and go back to detention." The words came out harsh. "Katie should be with someone who has a future, not someone marking time until probation ends."

Tommy drank his coffee, let silence settle. When he spoke his voice was measured.

"You know what I see? I see Katie looking happy for the first time in two years. I see her smiling again, staying late at the site when she doesn't have to, bringing you Coke and acting like it's just logistics." He paused. "Katie doesn't look at friends the way she looks at you."

"That's why I'm staying away. If Mike finds out—"

"Mike's not blind. He sees it too." Tommy's expression turned serious. "But here's the thing you need to understand. Mike will bury anyone who hurts his daughter. He's a good man, fair employer, solid friend. But Katie and Beth are everything to him. Ellen's death taught him how fast you can lose what matters. So if you're interested in Katie, you better be serious. Because if you break her heart, Mike won't fire you—he'll make you wish you'd never come to Meadowbrook."

The threat wasn't angry, just factual. I believed every word.

"I have no business with Katie. She deserves someone—"

"That's Katie's decision, not yours." Tommy cut through my protest. "If Katie wants to spend time with you, that's her choice. She's twenty years old and smart as hell. Stop deciding what's good for her and let her decide for herself."

I stared at my coffee. Tommy was right. But admitting I wanted Katie felt like crossing a line I couldn't uncross.

"I don't want to hurt her."

"Then don't. Be honest. Be careful. Respect that her father's your boss and her life's complicated. But don't lie to yourself or her about what's happening."

We finished our coffee talking about work—the new subdivision starting next month, Mike's plans to expand the crew, whether Jim would ever stop complaining about the heat. Normal conversation. But Tommy's words sat heavy in my chest.

When we left Callahan's, Tommy clapped my shoulder. "You're a good guy, Alex. The crew sees it. Mike sees it. Katie definitely sees it." He climbed into his Chevy. "See you Monday."

I drove back to my room thinking about Katie's smile and Tommy's warning and the impossible situation I'd found myself in.

Monday morning the crew was different. Ray greeted me with a nod and actual warmth. "Alex. Good weekend?"

"Yeah. You?"

"Won forty bucks on Saturday's race." Ray grinned. "Told you that horse had good odds."

Pete asked me to help with the roof trusses—complex angles that required precision. Jim handed me his good level without me asking, which felt significant. The crew had shifted from tolerating me to including me.

At lunch they made room at the plywood stack without prompting. Tommy talked about his poker game. Ray planned another track visit. Pete mentioned his anniversary dinner went well. Normal crew banter, and I was part of it.

"You coming to the Fourth of July picnic?" Ray asked. "Sullivan Construction sponsors it every year. Burgers, baseball, fireworks."

"I didn't know about it."

"Now you do. It's mandatory fun." Ray smiled. "Mike's rules."

Belonging crept up slow and terrifying. These guys were becoming friends. This job was becoming a career. Meadowbrook was becoming home. Everything I'd told myself to avoid—attachment, hope, permanence—was happening anyway.

Mid-afternoon Katie found me at the site. "I need help measuring for cabinet installation. You have time?"

"Sure."

We walked to the second house where the kitchen was framed but not finished. Katie had blueprints and her measuring tape. The space was tight—two people, tools, lumber stacked in corners. Summer heat made everything close and immediate.

"Cabinets go here." Katie indicated the wall. "Upper and lower. I need exact measurements for the carpenter."

I held one end of the tape while she pulled it across. Our hands brushed when she reached for her pencil. The contact lasted half a second. Neither of us acknowledged it. But the air changed.

"Seventy-two inches," Katie said, marking her notes.

"Check it again. Looked like seventy-two and a quarter."

She re-measured. "You're right. Good eye."

We moved to the next wall. This time when she reached past me for the level, her shoulder brushed mine. We were standing closer than necessary in the unfinished kitchen with sawdust floating through afternoon light.

"Lower cabinets need to account for countertop overhang," Katie said, all business. But her voice was slightly breathless.

"What's the standard?"

"One inch." She made another note, didn't step back. "Alex—"

"Yeah?"

"Nothing." Katie measured the backsplash area, movements efficient but her hands not quite steady. "Forty-eight inches here."

I wrote it down. We finished measuring in charged silence. Every accidental contact felt deliberate. Every moment of proximity impossible to ignore. The unfinished kitchen felt smaller with each passing minute.

"That's everything." Katie rolled up the blueprints. "Thanks for helping."

"No problem."

She walked to the door, paused, turned back. "Tommy talked to you Friday night."

Not a question. I nodded.

"He means well. He's protective."

"I know."

"He's not wrong though." Katie met my eyes. "About people being able to make their own decisions."

She left before I could respond. I stood in the empty kitchen with sawdust and summer heat and the phantom feeling of her shoulder against mine.

Tommy was right. Katie was right. Something was happening between us whether I acknowledged it or not. The question was whether I had the courage to want it—to let myself belong here, care about these people, risk everything detention had taught me to protect.

I gathered my tools as the sun dropped toward evening. The crew called goodbyes heading to their trucks. Tommy gave me a knowing look. Ray waved. Pete reminded me about the Fourth of July picnic.

Belonging terrified me. Caring about Katie terrified me. But walking away from it terrified me more.

Maybe that was what second chances meant—choosing to want good things even when wanting them scared you. Choosing to stay even when leaving felt safer.

I climbed into the Ford and drove to my room thinking about Katie's shoulder against mine and the crew's acceptance and how much I had to lose if I screwed this up.

For the first time in months, having something to lose felt like having something worth keeping.
