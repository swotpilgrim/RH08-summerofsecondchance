# Chapter 15: Tools Go Missing

Monday morning Mike discovered the power drill was missing from the tool shed. He mentioned it at the morning briefing, voice casual but concerned.

"Anyone seen the Dewalt drill? Yellow case, battery pack. It was in the shed Friday."

The crew shook their heads. Tommy checked his truck. Ray looked through his toolbox. Pete and Jim did the same. Nothing.

"Probably just misplaced," Mike said. "Keep an eye out for it."

I felt the shift immediately. Eyes turning toward me. Quick sideways glances. The unspoken question hanging in the air: did the ex-con take it? Nobody said anything directly. But the suspicion was palpable, thick as sawdust.

I worked through the morning with my jaw clenched, hyperaware of every look, every pause in conversation when I approached. The easy camaraderie I'd built with the crew felt fragile, ready to shatter at the first real test.

And this was that test.

Wednesday the circular saw disappeared. Mike discovered it missing when he went to make cuts for the roof trusses. He stood at the saw station looking at the empty space where the expensive Makita should have been, expression unreadable.

"The circular saw's gone too," he announced to the crew. "Anyone move it? Take it to another house?"

Silence. Then Ray spoke up, voice carefully neutral. "That's two expensive tools in three days. Dewalt drill runs about a hundred bucks. Makita saw another hundred-fifty. That's serious money."

The crew nodded. Jim muttered something about needing better security. Pete suggested locking the tool shed. Nobody looked directly at me but I felt the accusation in the air like humidity before a storm.

The ex-con. The obvious suspect. The guy with a record.

Tommy caught my eye across the site, gave me a slight nod. Solidarity or reassurance, I wasn't sure. But he was the only one who didn't seem to be mentally calculating whether I'd stolen the tools.

Mike organized a thorough search. Everyone checked their trucks, the houses, the office, the lumber stacks. We spent an hour looking. Nothing. The tools were simply gone.

"All right," Mike said finally. "Back to work. Keep your eyes open. If someone finds them, let me know."

The crew dispersed. I picked up my hammer and tried to focus on framing, but every conversation I overheard felt loaded with implication.

"...expensive to replace..."

"...better security measures..."

"...can't trust everyone..."

Nobody said my name. Nobody had to.

At lunch the crew gathered at Callahan's as usual. I sat at the counter instead of our booth, putting physical distance between myself and the suspicion. Mrs. Callahan brought coffee without comment but her expression was cooler than usual.

Even she thought I'd done it.

Katie slid onto the stool beside me. "Why are you sitting here instead of with everyone else?"

"Just wanted to eat alone."

"Alex." Her voice was quiet. "Nobody thinks you took the tools."

"Don't they?" I looked at the crew's booth where Ray, Pete, and Jim were having an animated conversation. "Ray's calculating replacement costs. Jim's talking about security. Everyone's looking at me like I'm the obvious answer to their problem."

"You're being paranoid."

"Am I? Or am I the first person everyone suspects because I'm the one with a criminal record?" The words came out bitter. "It doesn't matter that I've worked hard for two months. Doesn't matter that I've never given them reason to doubt me. One thing goes wrong and I'm automatically guilty."

Katie's expression shifted—wanting to argue but unable to fully deny the truth of what I was saying.

"My father doesn't think you took them. He would have said something if he did."

"Maybe he's just waiting for proof. Or maybe he's too polite to accuse me directly." I finished my coffee, set down cash for the bill. "I'm going back to the site."

I walked out before Katie could respond, leaving her at the counter with her untouched lunch.

That evening I stayed late after the crew left. If I couldn't prove I didn't take the tools, maybe I could prove my innocence by finding them. Someone had stolen them—that was obvious. But it wasn't me. And somewhere on this site there had to be evidence.

I searched methodically. Tool shed first, going through every corner, every box, every shelf. Nothing. Then the houses, checking closets and crawl spaces, anywhere someone might hide expensive equipment. The lumber stacks next, moving boards to check underneath. The office, though that felt pointless—Katie would have noticed strange tools.

Dusk settled over the construction site. I worked by fading light, desperate and determined, knowing how pathetic this looked but unable to stop. If I found the tools it would prove my innocence. If I didn't, at least I'd tried.

"What are you doing?"

Katie's voice made me turn. She stood at the edge of the lumber stack, clipboard in hand, watching me move boards with methodical precision.

"Looking for the missing tools."

"Why?"

"Because everyone thinks I took them and I need to prove I didn't." I moved another board, checked underneath. Nothing. "If I can find them, show they were just misplaced or hidden somewhere, maybe everyone will stop looking at me like I'm the obvious thief."

Katie climbed over boards to where I was working. "Nobody thinks you're a thief."

"Yes they do. Ray does. Jim does. Pete does. Mrs. Callahan barely spoke to me at lunch. The whole crew is calculating replacement costs and talking about security and looking at me with suspicion." I moved to the next stack. "I can see it in their eyes. The ex-con did it. Who else would steal tools?"

"My father doesn't think that. Tommy doesn't think that. I don't think that."

"You're the only ones." I stopped working, looked at Katie. "And even you have doubt. I can see it. You want to believe me but there's that tiny part of you wondering if maybe everyone else is right."

Katie's expression flickered—guilt and denial and truth all mixed together. "I don't think you took the tools."

"But you're not sure. Nobody is. Because once you're an ex-con, you're always guilty until proven innocent. That's how it works." The bitterness in my voice surprised me. "I thought working hard and staying clean would be enough. That eventually people would see me for who I am now instead of what I did before. But I was wrong. First thing goes wrong and everyone remembers I'm the guy who doesn't belong."

"That's not true."

"Isn't it? Beth warned me I'd never really fit in Meadowbrook. She was right. I can work construction and go to dances and drink coffee on office steps, but I'll always be the ex-con Mike took a chance on. First suspect. Permanent outsider."

Katie reached for my hand but I pulled away. The rejection hurt her—I saw it in her eyes—but I couldn't handle comfort that came from doubt.

"I believe you didn't take the tools," Katie said firmly.

"You want to believe it. That's different."

"No, it's not. I know you, Alex. You wouldn't steal from my father. You wouldn't jeopardize your probation for a hundred-dollar drill. You care too much about this job, about proving yourself. Theft doesn't make sense."

The logic was sound but it didn't erase the doubt I'd seen in her eyes. Doubt that mirrored the crew's suspicion, Beth's warnings, the town's judgment.

Maybe everyone was right to doubt. Maybe I was fooling myself thinking I could build a real life here. Maybe Meadowbrook was just a temporary stop before inevitable failure.

"I should go." I grabbed my jacket from the lumber stack. "It's getting dark."

"Alex, wait—"

"I'll see you tomorrow, Katie. For work."

I walked to my truck leaving her standing in the construction site at dusk. In the rearview mirror she looked small and alone surrounded by framed houses and shadows.

I drove back to my room thinking about missing tools and immediate suspicion and how fragile belonging really was. Two months of hard work, erased by one accusation. Two months of building trust, shattered by two missing tools.

Beth had been right. I should have left before Katie got attached, before I got attached, before I started believing I could actually build a life here.

The room above the office felt empty and temporary. I looked at the curtains Katie had hung, the furniture she'd helped me arrange, the photo of my mother on the windowsill. All of it suddenly felt like props in a temporary stage set, not the foundation of a real life.

I'd been fooling myself. Playing house. Pretending I could be someone worth Katie's faith and Mike's trust and the crew's respect. But at the first real test, everything had fallen apart.

Maybe detention had been right: don't want things, don't trust people, don't believe good things can last. Wanting made you vulnerable. Trust made you weak. Hope set you up for devastating disappointment.

I'd let myself want. Let myself trust. Let myself hope. And now I was paying the price.

I lay awake thinking about Katie's hurt expression and the crew's suspicion and Mike's careful neutrality. About missing tools I didn't take and proof I couldn't provide and the inevitable guilt of always being the first suspect.

Tomorrow I'd show up for work because probation required it. I'd keep my head down, do my job, maintain professional distance. No more morning coffee with Katie. No more staying late. No more hoping I could belong.

Tomorrow I'd start protecting myself again.

Starting tomorrow.
