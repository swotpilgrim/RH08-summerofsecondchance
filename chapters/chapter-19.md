# Chapter 19: Catching the Thief

I didn't sleep well Wednesday night. Kept replaying Ray unlocking the tool shed, loading equipment like it was his right. Kept thinking about how easily he'd let everyone suspect me.

But mostly I thought about Katie's kiss. The way she'd said she loved me. How for the first time, I'd said it back.

Thursday morning, I arrived at the site early. Katie's truck was already there, and Mike's too. They stood by the office trailer, talking in low voices. Katie saw me and waved me over.

"We're going to tell everyone together," Mike said. His face looked drawn, older than usual. "I don't want this hanging over the crew another day."

The others arrived one by one. Tommy. Pete and Joe. Carl. Ray rolled in last, coffee in hand, looking relaxed as he climbed out of his truck.

Mike called us all together beside the tool shed.

"I need to address something," Mike said, his voice carrying that flat, hard tone from when he'd called the meeting about the thefts. "Last night, I had help staking out this job site."

Ray's expression didn't change, but I saw his hand tighten on his coffee cup.

"At eleven-thirty PM, someone arrived with a key to the tool shed." Mike's eyes moved to Ray. "Unlocked it, loaded tools into a bag, and left. Katie and Alex witnessed it. I've asked them to tell me who they saw."

Every head turned toward us. Katie stepped forward, chin up, voice steady.

"It was Ray," she said. "We watched him take a drill, hand saw, and boxes of nails."

The silence that followed felt explosive. Ray's face went white, then red.

"That's a lie," he said, but his voice cracked.

"It's not," I said quietly. "We both saw you. Clear as day in the moonlight."

"You're covering for yourself—" Ray started.

"Enough." Mike's word cut through the air like a blade. "Ray, my office. Now. The rest of you, take an early break. This won't take long."

Ray followed Mike into the office trailer like a man walking to his execution. The door closed behind them.

Tommy let out a low whistle. "Well, hell."

"Didn't want to believe it," Pete said, shaking his head. "Ray's been here longer than any of us."

"Why would he do it?" Joe asked. "Mike pays fair."

"Doesn't matter why," Carl said flatly. "Man stole from his crew. Let Alex take the blame. That's lower than low."

They all looked at me then—assessing, apologetic, uncertain. I kept my face neutral, hands in my pockets.

Katie moved to stand beside me, close enough that our shoulders touched. A statement to the crew: she was with me. Believed me. Chose me.

The office door opened fifteen minutes later. Ray emerged looking gutted—face pale, eyes red. Mike followed, expression grim.

"Ray has something to say," Mike announced.

Ray cleared his throat, looking at his boots. "I've been stealing tools for the past six months. Selling them to cover gambling debts. Got in deep with a bookie in Pittsburgh, panicked, made bad choices." His voice was hoarse. "I let you all think it might be Alex because—because it was easier than admitting what I'd done. That was wrong. I'm sorry."

He looked up then, directly at me. "I'm sorry, Alex. You got a raw deal, and I made it worse. That's on me."

I didn't know what to say. Part of me wanted to rage at him—he'd put my freedom at risk, made me relive detention searches, nearly destroyed what I was building here. But looking at Ray's broken expression, I just felt tired.

"Why?" I asked. "Why gambling? Why not ask Mike for help if you needed money?"

"Pride, I guess." Ray's laugh was bitter. "Thought I could fix it myself. Keep doubling down, sure the next bet would pay off. It never did. Just got deeper." He turned to Mike. "I'll return everything I took. Every tool, every cent. Whatever you want."

Mike's jaw was tight. "You're fired, Ray. Effective immediately."

Ray nodded like he'd expected it. "Fair enough."

"You've got one week to return every tool you stole," Mike continued. "Every single one, with receipts for anything you already sold. If I'm missing so much as a screwdriver after seven days, I press charges. Understand?"

"Yes, sir." Ray's voice was barely audible.

"Now get off my job site."

Ray walked to his truck without looking at any of us. The engine started, and he drove away. None of us spoke until the sound faded completely.

"All right," Mike said finally. "Let's talk about this because I'm only saying it once. Ray made choices—bad ones—and he's paying for them. That's justice. But what happened to Alex was wrong."

He looked at me directly. "I should've trusted my instincts. Should've known you wouldn't steal from me. Instead, I let doubt creep in, and for that, I apologize."

The words hit harder than I expected. Mike Sullivan didn't strike me as a man who apologized often.

"You had reason to be cautious," I said.

"No." Mike shook his head. "I had nine months of you showing up on time, working hard, fixing your mistakes, and proving yourself. That should've counted for more than suspicion. I'm sorry."

Tommy stepped forward. "I knew it wasn't you. Told anyone who'd listen you didn't have it in you to steal from the crew."

"I should've been more vocal about it," Pete added. "Sorry, Alex."

Joe and Carl murmured agreement, looking uncomfortable but sincere.

I felt something loosen in my chest. Not complete trust—that would take time—but acknowledgment. Recognition that I'd earned my place here.

"Appreciate it," I said. "All of you."

"Now let's get to work," Mike said. "We've got houses to finish, and standing around talking doesn't get drywall hung."

The crew dispersed, the tension broken if not completely gone. Katie caught my eye, smiled. I smiled back—small, real.

I worked through the morning in a strange fog. Kept expecting to feel angrier, more triumphant. Instead, I just felt hollowed out. Vindicated, yes. But also strangely sorry for Ray.

At lunch, I sat on the tailgate of my truck, eating the sandwich Mrs. Fletcher had packed. Katie found me there.

"How are you feeling?" she asked, hopping up to sit beside me.

"Weird."

"Good weird or bad weird?"

"Just weird." I took a bite of sandwich, chewed, swallowed. "I thought proving I didn't steal would feel better. But mostly I keep thinking about Ray. How desperate he must've been. How easy it was for him to use me."

Katie was quiet for a moment. "You're allowed to be angry."

"I know. I am angry. But I also—" I struggled to find the words. "I get it. Making bad choices because you're desperate. Lying to cover them up. That's not so different from the guy I used to be."

"You stole a car because your friends pressured you," Katie said gently. "Ray stole from his crew and let you take the blame. Those aren't the same thing."

"Aren't they? We both made choices we regretted. We both hurt people who trusted us."

"Maybe." Katie took my hand. "But you're also the guy who took responsibility, served your time, and came here trying to build something better. Ray just kept digging deeper."

I squeezed her fingers. "When did you get so wise?"

"I've always been wise. You're just now noticing." Her smile took the sting out of the words. "My point is, you're allowed to feel sorry for Ray and still recognize what he did was wrong. Both can be true."

"Yeah." I pulled her closer, rested my forehead against hers. "Thank you. For believing in me. For investigating when everyone else accepted the easy answer."

"Always." She kissed me, quick and sweet. "Besides, I'm selfish. I wanted you to stay, and you weren't going to stay if you kept getting blamed for things you didn't do."

"I'm staying," I promised. "Even though Ray's gone and I'm cleared. I'm staying."

"Good." Katie pulled back to look at me, eyes serious. "Because I love you, and I need you to stop waiting for permission to be happy."

"I love you too," I said, and this time the words came easier. "And I'm working on the happy part."

"That's all I ask." She hopped down from the tailgate. "Come on. If we're late getting back, my father will give us that look."

"What look?"

"The one that says he knows exactly what we've been doing but he's choosing to pretend he doesn't." Katie grinned. "It's terrifying and hilarious at the same time."

I laughed—actually laughed—and followed her back to the job site.

The afternoon passed in solid work. Mike set me to installing door frames, trusting me with precision work. Tommy worked nearby, kept the conversation light. Pete asked my opinion on a tricky corner cut and actually listened to my answer.

Small things. But they added up to something bigger: acceptance.

Around four, Mike called me over to where he was checking measurements.

"I want you to know something," he said quietly. "I meant what I said this morning. You've proven yourself here. Not just today, but every day for nine months. That matters."

"Thank you, sir."

"And for what it's worth?" Mike glanced toward where Katie was organizing materials. "My daughter's happy. Really happy, for the first time since her mother died. I think you have something to do with that."

My face went hot. "I—"

"Don't make speeches," Mike said. "Just keep making her happy. And if you hurt her, I don't care how good your finish carpentry is—I'll bury you under the foundation of the next house."

He said it with a slight smile, but I heard the steel underneath.

"Understood," I said.

"Good." Mike clapped me on the shoulder. "Now get back to work."

I went back to the door frames, but I couldn't stop smiling.

Ray was gone. I was cleared. The crew believed in me.

Katie loved me, and her father knew it—and hadn't fired me or threatened my probation.

For the first time in longer than I could remember, everything felt like it might actually be okay.

Maybe better than okay.

Maybe—just maybe—I was building something real here.

Something that would last.

And for the first time, I let myself believe I deserved it.
