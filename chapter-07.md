# Chapter 7: Sunday Dinner Invitation

Mike caught me Friday afternoon as I loaded tools. The crew had left, trucks disappearing in dust. I was last on site like usual, checking the storage lock.

"Alex. Got a minute?"

I turned. Mike stood by his truck, casual but purposeful. "Yes, sir."

"Mike."

"Mike."

He walked over. "You're doing good here. Tommy says you've got a real feel for the trade."

"Thank you."

"Katie mentioned you're settling into the room. Everything okay?"

"It's great. Thank you for the opportunity."

"She's got a practical head." Mike leaned against the trailer. "We have Sunday dinner every week. Just family. Tradition we kept after my wife passed. You're welcome to join us this Sunday if you want. Six o'clock. Katie thought you might appreciate a home-cooked meal." Mike's expression was genuine. "What do you say?"

Every instinct said decline. But refusing felt like rejecting kindness.

"I don't want to intrude."

"You're not intruding if you're invited. It's just dinner. Katie makes a mean pot roast, and it's nice to have someone new at the table."

"Okay. Thank you. Six o'clock."

Mike smiled, clapped my shoulder. "Good. Katie will be glad."

He drove off, leaving me wondering what I'd agreed to.

Sunday arrived too fast. By five-thirty I'd changed shirts three times, settling on the least worn button-up. I checked my reflection in the small bathroom mirror—hair combed, face shaved, presentable. The face looking back still felt like a stranger's. Eighteen but with eyes that had seen too much.

The Sullivan house sat on Maple Street—two-story frame with white siding, neat lawn, flowers blooming in careful beds. The kind of house that looked like family. Like permanence. Like everything I'd lost and wasn't sure I deserved to find again.

I parked the Ford at the curb and sat gathering courage. Through the front window I could see movement, hear music drifting out—something jazzy and warm. Normal family Sunday. The kind I'd imagined other people had while I was locked up counting days.

I climbed the steps and knocked.

Katie answered in a blue dress, hair down, smile genuine. "You came."

"Said I would."

"Come in. Dinner's almost ready."

I walked into warmth and cooking smells—pot roast, herbs, something sweet baking. The house was modest but comfortable, with worn hardwood floors and furniture that had been loved for years. Photos covered every surface—Katie and Beth as kids with missing teeth and ponytails, Mike and Ellen on their wedding day, family gatherings around Christmas trees and birthday cakes. A life documented in black and white and faded color.

"That's my mom," Katie said softly, noticing where I was looking. She pointed to a photo of Ellen in the garden, smiling at the camera. "Two years ago this August. The last good summer."

"She looks happy."

"She was. We all were." Katie touched the frame gently. "Come on. Let me get you something to drink."

Mike appeared in slacks and polo. "Alex. Glad you could make it. Water, coffee?"

"Water's fine."

We settled in the living room. Radio played low. Photos of Ellen watched from the mantle.

"How's the truck?"

"Good. Tommy's father looked it over, said it's solid."

"You're in good hands with Ricci."

Beth appeared in the doorway, expression guarded. "Dinner's ready."

The table was set for four. Katie brought out pot roast on a platter, surrounded by carrots and potatoes. Beth carried rolls. Mike gestured to a chair.

I sat across from Katie, next to Mike. Beth took the remaining seat, watching me with suspicion. Katie served the roast. Mike said grace—thanking God for food and company—and we ate.

The pot roast was incredible. Better than anything I'd had in years. I ate slowly, aware of Beth's eyes tracking every move.

"This is really good," I said to Katie. "Thank you for inviting me."

"You're welcome. Dad said you've been eating a lot of canned soup. Figured you could use a real meal."

"Katie learned from her mother," Mike said. "Ellen said Sunday dinner was sacred."

"We kept it up," Katie added. "Even when things were hard."

Awkward silence settled. Beth broke it.

"So what are you planning to do after probation ends?"

"Beth," Katie warned.

"What? I'm just asking." Beth's tone was innocent but her eyes were sharp. "You've got, what, a year left? Then you're free to go anywhere. So where will you go?"

I set down my fork. "I haven't decided."

"But you are planning to leave." Not a question.

"Beth, enough," Mike said firmly.

"I'm just saying what everyone's thinking. He's not staying. Why get attached?"

Katie's face flushed. "This is just dinner, Beth. Can we not?"

"You're allowed to be polite," Mike corrected. "If you can't be civil, eat in the kitchen."

Beth went quiet, stabbing her potatoes. The tension was thick. I wanted to disappear.

"I apologize," I said quietly. "I didn't mean to cause family problems."

"You didn't cause anything," Katie said firmly, glaring at her sister. "Beth's just being—"

"Protective," Beth interrupted. "Someone has to be."

Mike set down his fork hard. "Elizabeth. Living room. Now."

Beth followed him out. Their voices carried—Mike stern, Beth defensive. Katie stared at her plate.

"I'm sorry. Beth's been like this since Mom died. Hypervigilant about anything she thinks might hurt us."

"She's not wrong though," I said. "I am on probation. I will leave eventually. Getting attached probably isn't smart."

Katie looked up, eyes bright with something between anger and hurt. "Is that what you think? That caring about people is only worth it if it's permanent?"

"I think caring about people when you don't know your own future is dangerous."

"Life is dangerous. Loving people is dangerous. My mother died suddenly and it destroyed us. But the twenty years we had were worth it." Katie's voice was fierce. "Beth's scared because she lost her mother. But being scared isn't an excuse to push people away."

"Maybe she's right to be scared."

"Maybe she is. But maybe—" Katie stopped as Mike and Beth returned.

Beth sat down stiffly, face red. "I apologize for being rude. You're our guest and I was out of line."

The apology was clearly forced, but I accepted it. "It's okay. I understand."

Dinner resumed in uncomfortable silence. Mike asked about work. Katie talked about supply orders. Beth said nothing. By dessert I was counting minutes.

The pie was excellent. Katie smiled but it didn't reach her eyes.

After dinner Mike offered to show me his workshop—an escape we both needed. The garage was organized chaos: tools on pegboards arranged by size and function, sawhorses in the corner, workbench covered in projects at various stages. A hand plane mid-restoration, drawer pulls waiting for finish, a jewelry box taking shape from bird's-eye maple. Mike's refuge, the place where he built things that mattered.

He picked up the jewelry box, ran his thumb over the smooth grain. "Making this for Beth's birthday. Ellen always said a man who works with his hands should make beautiful things, not just functional ones."

I examined the dovetail joints—perfect, tight, the mark of real craftsmanship. "It's beautiful."

"Thank you." He set it down carefully. "I apologize for Beth. Tonight was over the line."

"She's not wrong about me leaving."

"Are you? Leaving, I mean."

The question hung in the air between hammers and saws, in this space where Mike built things with his hands the way he seemed to build everything—solid, lasting, true.

"I don't know. Month ago yes. Now—" I stopped, looking at the tools that had created the jewelry box, the careful work of a man who believed in making things that endured. "Now I'm not sure."

"What changed?"

Everything. The work, the crew, Katie. Belonging. The possibility that I could be more than my worst mistake. I couldn't say all that.

"The job. I like building things that last. Learning from you."

Mike nodded slowly, picked up the hand plane he was restoring. "You're talented. With training you could get your contractor's license, run your own crew someday." He tested the blade, adjusted it with practiced fingers. "You've got a future here if you want it. Real future, not just marking time until probation ends."

"What if I make the wrong choice?"

"Then you make a different choice next time. That's what second chances are for." Mike met my eyes. "My wife said the worst thing you can do is make no choice at all. Standing still because you're afraid—that's not living, that's just waiting."

I realized Mike was offering more than a job. He was offering belonging, future, the chance to build a life instead of just serving time.

"Thank you. For dinner. For taking a chance on me."

"Thank yourself by doing good work." Mike headed in. "Come on. Least you can do is have another slice of pie."

We returned to coffee and more pie. Beth had disappeared upstairs. Katie smiled when she saw us. I stayed another hour—coffee, conversation, Katie telling stories about Ellen. When I left, Katie walked me to the porch.

"Sorry about Beth."

"She's protecting you."

Katie leaned against the railing. "Are you planning to leave?"

"I don't know anymore."

"What would make you stay?"

The question hung between us. I could deflect or be honest.

"Feeling like I deserve to. Like I'm more than my record. Like I belong."

Katie's hand found mine. "You do belong. You just have to believe it."

Standing on the porch holding her hand, I wanted to believe it was possible.

"I'll work on it."

Katie smiled, squeezed my hand. "See you Monday."

I drove back thinking about Sunday dinners and Katie's hand in mine. About Mike's belief I could have a future. About Beth's fierce protection.

Maybe belonging was worth the risk. Maybe staying was worth the fear.

Maybe.
