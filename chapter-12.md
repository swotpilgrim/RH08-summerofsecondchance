# Chapter 12: Building Something Real

The construction progressed through late July into August with satisfying momentum. Three houses stood fully framed, windows installed, roofs shingled. Two more foundations had been poured and cured. The development was taking shape—transforming from blueprints and dirt into actual homes where families would live.

My role had expanded. Mike pulled me from general framing to teach me finish carpentry—the detail work that transformed rough construction into livable space. Cabinet installation, crown molding, door casings, baseboards. Precision work that required patience and exactness.

"This is where craftsmanship shows," Mike said Wednesday morning, demonstrating how to cut crown molding at the correct angle. "Anyone can frame walls. Good finish work separates builders from carpenters."

I watched his technique—measuring twice, marking carefully, cutting with the miter saw set to precisely forty-five degrees. The piece fit perfectly against the wall and ceiling, creating the seamless corner that looked effortless but required skill.

"You try." Mike handed me the saw and a length of molding.

I measured, checked the angle, made the cut. The piece fit almost perfectly—within an eighth inch.

"Close. But close isn't right." Mike indicated the slight gap. "This is finish work. It has to be exact. Try again."

I spent the morning cutting and refitting crown molding until every joint was perfect. The work was meticulous and demanding and I loved it. There was something deeply satisfying about precision—about making pieces fit so perfectly the seams disappeared.

By afternoon Mike nodded approval at my work. "You've got a feel for this. Detail work requires patience most guys don't have. But you do."

The compliment meant more than it should. Mike's approval had become something I craved—validation that I was good at this trade, that I belonged here.

Katie appeared in the doorway of the house carrying her camera. "Mind if I photograph the progress? We need updated records for the files."

"Go ahead," Mike said. "Alex, show her what you've been working on."

Katie moved through the rooms photographing framed windows, installed cabinets, the crown molding I'd spent all morning perfecting. I continued working on the next section, aware of her presence, the click of the camera shutter, the way she studied my technique.

"Hold that position," Katie said suddenly.

I looked up. She had the camera aimed at me mid-cut, focused on difficult miter work.

"Why are you photographing me?"

"Documentation. Sullivan Construction's skilled carpentry work." Her expression was innocent but her eyes held amusement. "Besides, you look good when you're concentrating."

She snapped the photo before I could respond and moved to the next room, leaving me holding a saw and trying not to smile.

We'd fallen into routines over the past weeks. Early morning coffee on the office steps before the crew arrived. Working together on measuring and supply coordination. Lunch at Callahan's Diner where Mrs. Callahan had gradually warmed from suspicious assessment to grudging approval.

"You two want the usual?" Mrs. Callahan asked Friday when Katie and I slid into our booth—it had become our booth, the corner spot where we'd sat that first lunch with Tommy.

"Please," Katie said.

Mrs. Callahan poured coffee without being asked, set down menus she knew we wouldn't need. "Burgers and fries?"

"Sounds good."

"Alex, you're looking healthier. Katie must be feeding you actual food instead of those sad sandwiches."

"I bring him leftovers sometimes," Katie admitted. "He was living on canned soup."

"Young men need proper meals." Mrs. Callahan's tone was matter-of-fact. "Katie's mother would approve of you looking after him."

She walked away before Katie could respond. I stared at my coffee. Mrs. Callahan's comment felt significant—implicit approval wrapped in practical observation. Like Katie and me had passed some invisible town test.

"She likes you," Katie said quietly.

"Took long enough."

"Mrs. Callahan doesn't trust easily. Neither does this town. But once they decide you're all right, they're loyal." Katie sipped her coffee. "You're becoming part of Meadowbrook whether you planned to or not."

The thought should have scared me. Six weeks ago belonging to Meadowbrook meant being trapped. Now it meant having roots, community, people who knew my name and expected me to show up.

The crew joined us—Tommy, Ray, Pete, Jim piling into the adjacent booth. Ray's odd tension from earlier in the week had faded. Now he included me in conversation about the upcoming Fourth of July picnic like it was assumed I'd attend.

"You coming to the picnic Saturday?" Ray asked. "Mike's sponsoring like always. Good food, baseball, fireworks after dark."

"Yeah, I'll be there."

"Bring your glove if you've got one. We play pickup baseball, need enough guys for teams."

"I haven't played in years."

"It's just for fun. Half of us can't hit worth a damn anyway." Ray grinned. "Katie keeps score because she's the only one who stays sober enough to count."

"Someone has to maintain standards," Katie said dryly.

The crew's banter continued—comfortable, familiar, including me naturally. This was belonging. This was what I'd been afraid to want. And now that I had it, the fear of losing it was worse than never having it at all.

That evening I stayed late practicing finish cuts. The crew had left, sun dropping toward the horizon, site quiet except for the sound of my saw and summer insects. I was working on a particularly difficult corner joint when Mike appeared.

"You're here late again."

"Just practicing. Trying to get this joint perfect."

Mike examined my work, tested the fit. "It's already perfect. You're overthinking it."

I set down the saw. "I want the work to be right."

"The work is right. You're good at this, Alex. Better than most guys I've trained. You don't have to prove yourself every single day."

"Feels like I do."

Mike leaned against the workbench, studied me with that direct assessment that saw too much. "You're afraid if you're not perfect I'll decide I made a mistake hiring you. That it?"

The observation was too accurate. I nodded.

"I didn't hire you because I thought you'd be perfect. I hired you because you needed a chance and I thought you'd work hard. You've exceeded every expectation." Mike's voice was firm. "You're part of Sullivan Construction now. Part of this crew. You don't have to earn that every day—you already have it."

The words made my throat tight. Mike's approval, his faith, meant everything. And that was exactly what terrified me.

"What if I screw up?"

"Then we'll fix it. That's what construction is—building things, making mistakes, fixing them, building better." Mike clapped my shoulder. "Katie's good for you. You're good for her. I see how you look at each other. I'm not blind."

My stomach dropped. "Sir—"

"Mike. And I'm not objecting. Katie's twenty years old and smart enough to make her own decisions. You treat her well, work hard, stay out of trouble. That's all I ask."

"I'm on probation. People talk."

"People always talk. What matters is what we build despite what people say." Mike gestured at the framed houses around us. "These houses will stand fifty years. Good work lasts. So do good relationships if you put in the effort."

He walked toward his truck, paused. "Stop overthinking, Alex. Just be happy. Life's too short and too uncertain to waste time being afraid of good things."

I stood in the empty construction site watching Mike drive away, his words echoing in my head. Tommy had said almost the same thing: stop overthinking and be happy. Like happiness was simple. Like wanting things didn't guarantee losing them.

Katie's truck pulled into the lot. She climbed out carrying two Cokes and a paper bag.

"Thought you might still be here. Brought dinner."

We sat on the office steps eating sandwiches Katie had made—actual food, not canned soup or peanut butter. The sun set over the framed houses painting everything orange and gold.

"My father talked to you," Katie said. It wasn't a question.

"Yeah. Gave me the speech about treating you well."

"He gave me the speech about making my own decisions and not letting fear stop me from living." Katie sipped her Coke. "I think he approves."

"Of me?"

"Of us. Whatever we're doing." Katie looked at me in fading light. "Are we doing something, Alex?"

The question deserved honesty. I could deflect or be brave. Mike had said stop overthinking. Tommy had said be happy. Katie had said she wanted to see where this went.

"Yeah. We're doing something."

"Good." Katie's smile was soft and genuine. "Because I like this. Working together. Coffee in the mornings. You staying late and me bringing dinner. All of it."

"Me too."

We finished eating as full dark settled. Stars appeared overhead. The construction site felt like its own world, separate from judgment and fear and everything that said this couldn't work.

"I should get home," Katie said eventually. "Beth worries if I'm late."

I walked her to her truck, hands in my pockets because I didn't trust myself to touch her. Katie paused at the driver's door.

"Thank you."

"For what?"

"For staying. For not running. For being brave enough to see where this goes." She reached out, squeezed my hand briefly. "See you tomorrow morning. Coffee?"

"Yeah. Coffee."

She drove away, taillights disappearing down the road. I stood in darkness thinking about Mike's speech and Katie's smile and the three framed houses rising from foundations I'd helped pour.

Building something real. That's what Mike had said. Good work lasts. So do good relationships if you put in the effort.

Maybe that was the answer. Maybe happiness wasn't about deserving good things or being perfect or protecting yourself from loss. Maybe it was about showing up every day, putting in the work, building something piece by piece until you'd constructed a life worth living.

I could do that. I was good at construction. Good at precision and patience and making pieces fit perfectly. Maybe building a life with Katie worked the same way—measure carefully, cut precisely, trust the work would hold.

I climbed into my truck thinking about tomorrow's coffee and the Fourth of July picnic and Katie photographing me at work like I was someone worth documenting.

For the first time since getting out of detention, I wasn't just surviving. I was building. And that made all the difference.
