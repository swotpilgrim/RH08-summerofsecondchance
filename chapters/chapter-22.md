# Chapter 22: Beth's Perspective Shift

Saturday morning found me at the job site alone, working on custom cabinets for the master bedroom of house six. Mike had designed them specifically for the client—a young couple expecting their first baby—and trusted me with the build.

I should've taken it as the compliment it was. Instead, I just focused on the work. Measuring, cutting, sanding. Repetitive. Mindless. Safe.

The screech of bike tires on gravel made me look up around eleven. Beth Sullivan coasted to a stop, dismounted, and pulled a paper bag from her bicycle basket.

Great. Just what I needed. Katie's teenage sister here to tell me what a screw-up I was.

"Mom made extra sandwiches," Beth said, walking over. "Figured you'd be here working yourself stupid instead of eating properly."

I set down my sandpaper. "Your mom's been dead two years."

"I know. I meant me. I made sandwiches." Beth thrust the bag at me. "Just take them, okay? I'm trying to do a nice thing here."

Suspicious but hungry, I opened the bag. Ham and cheese on rye, an apple, cookies that smelled homemade.

"Thanks," I said.

"You're welcome." Beth hopped up to sit on my work bench, legs swinging. "Can I talk to you?"

"Do I have a choice?"

"Not really." She waited until I'd unwrapped a sandwich. "I owe you an apology."

That stopped me mid-bite. "For what?"

"For being a jerk when you first started coming around. For assuming you'd hurt Katie and leave. For—" She paused. "For being wrong about you."

I chewed slowly, processing. "What changed your mind?"

"Watching Katie the past week." Beth's expression turned serious beyond her seventeen years. "She's miserable. Trying to hide it, but I can tell. And you look like you're dying inside too. So I figured maybe I got it wrong."

"Got what wrong?"

"That you're just using her or you don't care or you're going to bail the first time things get hard." Beth picked at the edge of the workbench. "You care too much. That's your problem. You care so much that you're willing to walk away because you think it's better for her."

"It is better for her."

"Says who?" Beth challenged. "You? Because Katie sure doesn't think so. She's walking around like someone died, and it's your fault."

The words hit harder than they should've. "Beth, it's complicated—"

"It's not, though." Beth's voice went quiet. "When my mom died, Katie stopped being Katie. She was seventeen, about to graduate, had this whole plan for architecture school. Then Mom died and everything changed."

I set down my sandwich, sensing this was important.

"Dad fell apart," Beth continued. "Just completely shut down. Couldn't function, couldn't work, could barely get out of bed. And I was fifteen and terrified and had no idea what to do. So Katie stepped up." Beth's eyes shone with tears she was trying to hold back. "She put her acceptance letter in a drawer and became the person we needed. Ran the business, took care of Dad, made sure I ate and got to school and had clean clothes. She never grieved. Never fell apart. Just held everything together."

"Katie told me some of this," I said softly.

"Did she tell you she's been taking care of everyone else for two years straight?" Beth wiped at her eyes. "Did she tell you that you're the first person since Mom died who made her think about what she wants for herself?"

The words settled in my chest, heavy and aching.

"When you two started spending time together," Beth said, "Katie changed. Started smiling again. Started talking about maybe reapplying to architecture school. Started acting like she had a future beyond just managing Dad's business and making sure I'm okay." Beth looked at me directly. "You gave her that. You made her want things again."

"I didn't mean—"

"I know you didn't mean to. You're too busy thinking you're not good enough for her." Beth's tone turned sharp. "But here's the thing, Alex: Katie's been existing instead of living for two years. You made her start living again. And now you're going to take that away from her because you're scared?"

"It's not that simple."

"It is that simple." Beth hopped down from the workbench. "If you leave, Katie will go back to just taking care of everyone else. She'll put her dreams away again. She'll be fine on the outside and dying on the inside, and it'll be your fault."

"Beth—"

"I was wrong about you," she said. "You're not going to hurt Katie by being an ex-con or having a record or whatever. You're going to hurt her by being too scared to stay. By deciding for her what she should want instead of letting her choose."

I opened my mouth. Closed it. Had no idea what to say.

"For what it's worth?" Beth added. "I think you should stay. I think you're good for Katie. I think you make her happy in a way she hasn't been in a long time." She grabbed her bike. "But if you do hurt her—if you stick around and then bail later—I will personally make your life hell. Clear?"

"Crystal."

"Good." Beth climbed onto her bike, then paused. "She loves you, you know. Really loves you. The kind Mom and Dad had. That's rare. Don't throw it away because you're scared."

She pedaled off before I could respond, leaving me alone with half a sandwich and the weight of her words pressing down on my chest.

---

I sat among the sawdust and wood shavings, Beth's lunch forgotten beside me.

Katie had stopped living to take care of everyone else. Had put her dreams away to hold her family together. Had been existing instead of living for two years.

And I'd made her want to live again.

The realization hurt. Not in a bad way, but in the way truth hurts when it forces you to see yourself clearly.

I'd been so focused on protecting Katie from me—from my record, my past, my fear that I'd disappoint her—that I hadn't considered I might be hurting her worse by leaving.

I stood up and walked through the half-finished house. Looked at the walls I'd framed, the trim I'd installed, the cabinets I was building. Solid work. Work that would last. Work I could be proud of.

I knew how to build things that lasted when it came to wood and nails.

But I'd been tearing down my own chance at building a life. Been so convinced I didn't deserve happiness that I'd been destroying the foundation before I'd even finished laying it.

Katie believed I deserved a second chance. Mike believed it. Tommy believed it. Even Beth, who'd started out suspicious and protective, believed it.

Everyone believed in me except me.

And that had to change.

Because Beth was right—Katie had chosen me. Had seen my record, my past, my scars, and chosen me anyway. And instead of honoring that choice by fighting for us, I'd been running away. Deciding for her what she should want. Treating her love like something I had to earn instead of something she'd freely given.

That wasn't fair to her.

And it wasn't fair to me either.

I finished the cabinets as the sun started to sink, working with a clarity I hadn't felt in days. Sanded them smooth, checked every joint, made sure they were perfect. These cabinets would hold a baby's clothes someday. Would be part of a family's home for years, maybe decades.

I wanted to build that kind of permanence in my own life.

Wanted Katie. Wanted this town. Wanted to stop running from fear and start running toward the future I actually wanted.

The question was whether I had the guts to try.

I cleaned up my work area, packed my tools, and locked the site. Then I stood there for a long moment, looking at the houses rising against the evening sky.

Foundations. Frames. Roofs. Walls. Built piece by piece, one day at a time, with faith that the structure would hold.

Maybe building a life worked the same way.

Maybe you just had to start, even when you were scared. Had to lay the foundation and trust it would hold. Had to keep building, one day at a time, until you had something worth protecting.

I climbed into my truck and drove toward town. Toward Maple Street. Toward the Sullivan house where Katie and Beth and Mike lived.

My hands were sweating on the steering wheel. My heart hammered against my ribs. I didn't have a speech prepared, didn't have the perfect words to fix what I'd broken.

But I had the truth.

And maybe that was enough to start with.

I loved Katie. Wanted a future with her. Was terrified of messing it up but more terrified of walking away.

That had to count for something.

I pulled up outside the Sullivan house as the last light faded from the sky. Lights glowed warm in the windows. Through the kitchen window, I could see movement—someone fixing dinner.

I sat in my truck for a full five minutes, working up the courage to knock on the door.

Then Beth's words came back to me: *You're going to hurt her by being too scared to stay.*

I'd been scared long enough.

Time to be brave.

I climbed out of the truck and walked to the door before I could talk myself out of it.

Knocked three times.

Beth answered, took one look at me, and smiled. "About damn time."

"Is Katie here?" I asked.

"Katie!" Beth hollered over her shoulder. "Alex is here!"

Footsteps. Then Katie appeared in the hallway behind Beth, and the look on her face when she saw me standing on the porch made my chest crack open.

Hope. Hurt. Question. All mixed together.

"Can we talk?" I asked.

Katie looked at me for a long moment. Then she nodded. "Yeah. We can talk."

Beth stepped aside with a satisfied expression, and Katie grabbed a sweater from the hook by the door.

"Let's walk," she said.

And just like that, I had my chance.

Now I just had to find the words to not waste it.
