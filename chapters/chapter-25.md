# Chapter 25: Officer Brennan's Visit

Officer Brennan showed up Tuesday morning just as the crew was taking first break. His patrol car pulled into the construction site, and I felt the old familiar clench in my gut—probation officer meant trouble, meant violations, meant going back.

But then I remembered: I wasn't that person anymore. Hadn't been for nine months.

"Morning, Alex," Brennan called, climbing out of the car. "Got time for our weekly?"

"Yeah, of course." I set down my tools and walked over.

Brennan surveyed the construction site with interest. "This the project you've been working on?"

"Yeah. Six houses. We're down to final finishes on the last two."

"Show me."

I led him through house five, pointing out the trim work I'd done, the custom cabinets being installed, the finish carpentry details. Brennan nodded along, asking questions that showed he was actually paying attention.

"Good work," he said finally. "Real good. You should be proud of this."

"I am," I admitted. And it was true. For the first time in my life, I could point to something I'd built and feel genuine pride.

Brennan gestured toward his patrol car. "Let's sit. I've got some things to discuss."

We sat in the car—me in the passenger seat, him in the driver's—and Brennan pulled out his file on me. The folder was thicker than it had been nine months ago, filled with weekly reports and check-in forms.

"Let's review where you're at," Brennan said, flipping through pages. "Nine months completed. Zero violations. Steady employment with excellent reports from your employer. No criminal activity, no association with known offenders, perfect attendance at check-ins." He looked up at me. "Alex, do you understand how rare this is?"

"How rare what is?"

"This." He tapped the file. "Most of my cases—especially the ones coming out of detention—they talk a good game about turning their lives around. But when it comes down to actually doing the work? They don't. They violate within the first three months. Get picked up for something stupid. Stop showing up to check-ins. Lose their jobs because they can't be bothered to show up on time."

"I promised I'd do the work," I said.

"And you have. You're exactly the kind of case I hope for when I take on someone fresh out of detention." Brennan closed the file. "So let's talk about the future. What are your plans after probation ends?"

"I'm staying in Meadowbrook," I said, the words coming easier now that I'd said them to Katie, to Mike, to myself. "Mike offered me permanent employment. I'm going to keep learning the trade, maybe pursue carpenter certification down the line. Build a career here."

Brennan's expression was approving. "That's a solid plan. Specific, achievable, with clear goals. I like it."

He made notes in the file, then looked at me again.

"I want to discuss two things with you," he said. "First: early termination."

My heart skipped. "Early termination?"

"Of your probation. You were sentenced to eighteen months. You've completed nine with a completely clean record. Given your exemplary performance, I can recommend early termination to the judge. If approved, you'd be done in a matter of weeks instead of waiting another nine months."

I couldn't breathe. "You can do that?"

"I can recommend it. Judge makes the final call, but with your record and my recommendation, there's a good chance he'd approve." Brennan leaned back in his seat. "Interested?"

"Yes." The word came out rough. "God, yes. That would—everything would—"

"You'd be off probation," Brennan confirmed. "No more weekly check-ins. No more curfew. No more restrictions on leaving the county. You'd be free and clear, legally speaking."

Free. The word tasted like hope.

"What's the second thing?" I asked.

"Sealing your juvenile record." Brennan pulled out a different form. "After probation ends—whether that's now or nine months from now—you can petition the court to seal your juvenile record. Means it won't show up on background checks, won't follow you around forever. For most legal purposes, it's like the conviction never happened."

I stared at him. "I didn't know that was possible."

"Most people don't. It's not automatic—you have to petition for it, and the judge has to approve. But given your clean record, steady employment, and evidence of rehabilitation, I think you'd have a strong case."

"What would I need to do?"

"File the petition after probation ends. I'd write a support letter. Your employer could write one too, if he's willing. The judge reviews everything and makes a decision. Could take a few months, but if approved, your record gets sealed."

A sealed record. No more being the ex-con. No more being the first suspect. Just Alex Brennan, carpenter.

"That's—" I couldn't find words. "That's what second chances actually look like, isn't it? Not just staying out of trouble, but getting a real fresh start."

"Exactly." Brennan smiled. "That's what the system is supposed to do—give people a path forward instead of tying them to their worst mistakes forever. Doesn't always work. Hell, doesn't usually work. But when it does?" He tapped my file. "This is what it looks like."

I sat there trying to process it all. Early termination. Sealed record. Freedom not just from detention but from the weight of the past.

"I want to pursue both," I said. "Early termination and sealing the record. Whatever I need to do, I'll do it."

"Good. I'll file the paperwork for early termination this week. Hearing will probably be scheduled within the month. As for sealing the record, we'll tackle that after probation officially ends." Brennan made more notes. "In the meantime, keep doing exactly what you've been doing. Show up. Work hard. Stay clean. Make the judge's decision easy."

"I will. I promise."

Brennan studied me for a moment. "You've changed a lot in nine months."

"Had good reasons to change."

"The Sullivan girl?"

I felt my face heat. "Katie's part of it. But also this." I gestured at the construction site. "Having work I'm good at. People who believe in me. A chance to build something real."

"And believing you deserve it," Brennan added. "That's the part most people never figure out. They get the opportunity but can't shake the belief they're not worth it. You've done the work on that too."

"I'm still working on it," I admitted. "Some days are easier than others. But yeah. I'm trying to believe I deserve the good things happening."

"That's all anyone can do—keep trying." Brennan closed my file and handed me a card. "This is the public defender who handles juvenile record petitions. When you're ready to file after probation ends, give her a call. Tell her I referred you."

I took the card, stared at it. This was real. This was happening.

"Thank you," I said, and the words felt inadequate. "For everything. For the structure, the accountability, for believing I could actually make it."

"You did the work, Alex. I just showed up once a week to make sure you stayed on track." Brennan started the engine. "Keep it up. I'll be in touch about the hearing date for early termination."

He dropped me back at the construction site, and I stood watching his patrol car drive away.

Nine months ago, seeing that car meant fear. Meant threat. Meant one wrong move and I'd be back in detention.

Now it meant possibility. Meant early freedom. Meant a sealed record and a real fresh start.

I walked back to house five in a daze. Tommy was installing baseboards and looked up when I entered.

"Everything okay with your PO?" he asked.

"Yeah." I picked up my tools, couldn't stop the smile spreading across my face. "Better than okay. Brennan's recommending early termination of my probation."

Tommy's eyes went wide. "Seriously?"

"And after that, I can petition to seal my juvenile record. Make it like it never happened."

"Alex, that's incredible!" Tommy set down his nail gun and grabbed my shoulder. "That's—man, you deserve this. You've worked your ass off."

"Thanks." The words felt too small, but I didn't know how else to express what this meant.

Katie appeared in the doorway, clipboard in hand, took one look at my face and smiled. "Good news?"

"The best," I said. "Tell you at lunch?"

"Can't wait." She blew me a kiss and disappeared back toward the office trailer.

I went back to work on the trim with hands that weren't quite steady. Everything was changing. Early termination. Sealed record. Permanent employment. Katie.

A future that looked nothing like the scared, defensive kid who'd shown up here nine months ago planning to keep his head down and run the moment probation ended.

I'd stopped running.

Started building instead.

And apparently, the universe was finally willing to build back.

By the time Mike called lunch, I'd finished two rooms worth of trim and could barely contain the energy buzzing under my skin.

Katie met me by my truck, and I told her everything—Brennan's visit, early termination, the sealed record.

"Alex, that's amazing!" She threw her arms around me, and I picked her up, spinning her around right there in the middle of the construction site.

"Hey!" Mike called from across the lot. "Save the celebration for after work hours!"

But he was grinning, and when I set Katie down, she was laughing.

"This is everything you've been working toward," she said. "Freedom. A real fresh start."

"Not everything," I corrected. "This is just the legal part. The real fresh start is you. This job. This life I'm building. Brennan's giving me the paperwork to make it official, but the actual fresh start? That's been happening all along."

Katie's eyes went soft. "Look at you, being all wise and profound."

"I have a good teacher." I kissed her quickly. "Thank you. For pushing me to stay. For believing in me. For making me believe in myself."

"Always," Katie said. "Now get back to work before my father fires both of us."

I went back to work with a lightness in my chest I'd never felt before.

Free. Not just from probation, but from the weight of believing I didn't deserve happiness.

That was the real second chance.

And I was finally ready to take it.
