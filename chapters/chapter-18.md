# Chapter 18: Investigation

Friday morning, I showed up determined to try. Talked to Tommy. Helped Pete carry lumber. Didn't hide during lunch.

Katie noticed. I caught her watching from the office trailer, a small smile on her face.

By Tuesday, another week had passed without incident. The crew's wariness eased. Mike assigned me trim work for the fourth house—a vote of confidence.

I was measuring window casings when Katie appeared with her clipboard and a thoughtful expression.

"Can I see last week's time sheets?" she asked Mike.

He looked up from the foundation forms he was checking. "Something wrong?"

"Maybe. I'm not sure yet." Katie tapped her pen against the clipboard. "Just want to cross-reference something."

Mike retrieved the sheets from the office trailer, and Katie spread them across the tailgate of her truck. I tried not to watch, but curiosity got the better of me. She was comparing dates, running her finger down columns of numbers, making notes.

"What're you doing?" Tommy asked, wandering over during break.

"Checking schedules," Katie said absently. Then her finger stopped on one line. Her eyes narrowed.

"Katie?" Mike stepped closer. "What is it?"

"Ray." She looked up. "Every time tools have gone missing, Ray left early that day. Said he had errands or personal business."

The words hung in the air. Mike's expression went carefully neutral.

"Could be coincidence," he said.

"Could be." Katie pulled another sheet from her clipboard—supply orders. "But I've been going through the account books. Small cash discrepancies over the past six months. Fifty dollars here, seventy-five there. They add up."

"How much?" Mike asked quietly.

"About four hundred dollars." Katie's voice was steady. "And Ray's been handling supply pickups most of that time."

Tommy let out a low whistle. I stayed quiet, watching Mike's face. The man looked like he'd been punched.

"Ray's worked for me five years," Mike said. "Why would he steal?"

"I don't know." Katie's expression gentled. "But the pattern's there, Dad. I think we need to pay attention to it."

Mike ran a hand over his face. "I don't want to accuse without proof."

"Then we get proof." Katie looked directly at me. "We watch the tool shed tonight. See if anyone comes back after hours."

"Tonight?" Mike shook his head. "Katie, this is serious. If you're wrong—"

"Then nobody knows we suspected anything and life goes on," Katie said. "But if I'm right, you need to know before more tools disappear and someone else gets blamed."

Someone else meaning me. The words weren't spoken, but everyone heard them anyway.

"I'll help," I said.

Mike turned to me, surprise clear on his face.

"If someone's stealing, it needs to stop," I continued. "And if it's not me, I want to know who it is."

Mike studied me for a long moment. Then he nodded. "All right. Tonight. But just the three of us, and we keep this quiet. I won't ruin a man's reputation on speculation."

---

We parked down the road at nine PM, Katie's Ford hidden behind trees with a view of the tool shed. Mike sat in front, Katie and I in the back.

The first night: nothing. We waited until midnight. Mike drove us back, agreeing to try again.

The second night: same. Katie brought sandwiches. We watched the empty shed.

"One more night," Katie said. "If nothing happens tomorrow, we drop it."

The third night, Mike had a late meeting and told us to start without him. Just Katie and me in her Ford, parked in the darkness.

"Thank you," Katie said softly. "For doing this with me."

"Your father's the one doing the stakeout," I pointed out.

"But you're the one who suggested helping. After everything that happened." She shifted in the driver's seat to look at me. "That took courage."

"Not really. Just seemed fair."

"It's not just," Katie said. "You could've walked away, let Mike handle it, kept your head down. But you didn't."

I shrugged, uncomfortable with the praise. "Told you I'd try. Showing up, right? One day at a time."

"You're doing more than showing up." Her voice held warmth that made my chest tight. "You're fighting for yourself. Finally."

We fell quiet, watching the empty construction site. An hour passed. Then another.

"We should probably give up," Katie said around eleven. "Mike's not coming, and whoever's stealing clearly isn't either."

"Five more minutes," I said, not ready to leave yet. Being here in the darkness with Katie felt separate from real life—a stolen moment where we could just exist without the weight of my record or her family or the crew's opinions pressing down.

"Alex." Katie's voice went soft. "About what I said Thursday. In the house."

My heart started hammering. "You don't have to—"

"I meant it," she interrupted. "I'm falling in love with you. I need you to know that wasn't just me being angry or trying to get through to you. It's real."

I turned to look at her. In the dim light from the dashboard, her face was half-shadow, but her eyes were steady on mine.

"I wanted to say something back," I admitted. "When you told me. But I couldn't get the words out."

"I know." She reached across the seat, found my hand. "You don't have to say anything you're not ready for."

"It's not that I'm not ready." I laced my fingers through hers, her touch warm and real. "I'm just—scared doesn't even cover it. Terrified of messing this up. Of being exactly what everyone warned you about."

"Everyone meaning who?"

"Your father. The town. That voice in my head that says ex-cons don't get happy endings with girls like you."

Katie's grip tightened. "Girls like me?"

"Good. Smart. Beautiful. With a future that doesn't include someone on probation who'll always be looked at sideways when something goes wrong."

"Stop," Katie said, but not unkindly. "Stop deciding what my future includes. That's my choice, not yours."

"I know. I'm trying to remember that." I took a breath, forced myself to meet her eyes. "Katie, I'm falling for you too. Have been since you brought me that Coca-Cola after I messed up the trim and stayed late. Since you treated me like I was worth more than my record."

Her smile could've lit up the whole car. "Yeah?"

"Yeah." The word came out rough. "I love the way you check your clipboard twice for everything. How you tuck your hair behind your ear when you're concentrating. The way you see people—really see them—instead of just what everyone else thinks. I love—" I stopped. The rest of the sentence caught in my throat.

"Say it," Katie whispered.

"I love you." Three words I'd never said to anyone, not even my mother before she died. Three words that felt like jumping off a cliff and hoping someone would catch me.

Katie made a small sound—half laugh, half sob—and then she was leaning across the seat, closing the distance between us.

She kissed me.

Her lips were soft and warm and tasted like the mint gum she'd been chewing earlier. Her hand came up to cup my face, gentle, like I was something precious instead of something broken.

I kissed her back, careful at first—terrified of doing it wrong, of being too much or not enough. But then Katie made another small sound, and my hand found her waist, and careful didn't matter anymore. Just her. Just this.

When we broke apart, both breathing hard, Katie rested her forehead against mine.

"I've wanted to do that for weeks," she whispered.

"Why didn't you?"

"Because you needed to believe you deserved it first." She pulled back enough to look at me, her hand still on my face. "Do you? Believe you deserve this?"

Did I? Part of me still wanted to say no, still heard that voice insisting I was wrong for her, that this would end badly, that I'd mess it up.

But a bigger part—the part that was learning to fight, to try, to show up—wanted to believe Katie when she said I was worth loving.

"I'm trying to," I said honestly.

"That's enough." She kissed me again, briefer this time. "We'll figure out the rest together."

Together. That word again. But this time it didn't feel so foreign. This time it felt possible.

A sound broke through the cricket song—an engine, distant but getting closer.

We broke apart. Katie turned to look through the windshield, and I followed her gaze.

Headlights on the road, moving slow. A truck turning onto the construction site access road.

"Someone's here," Katie breathed.

We ducked low in the seat, watching as the truck—too dark to identify in the dim light—pulled up to the tool shed. The engine cut off. A figure climbed out, familiar in build and movement.

Ray.

He walked to the tool shed with a key in his hand, unlocked the padlock like he had every right to be there, and opened the door. The flashlight beam swept inside, then Ray began loading items into a canvas bag.

"Should we confront him?" I whispered.

"No." Katie's voice was hard. "We wait for my father. This is his crew, his decision."

We watched Ray load tools, lock the shed back up, and drive away. The whole thing took less than ten minutes.

When his taillights disappeared, Katie sat up and started the engine. "Tomorrow morning, we tell Dad. With both of us as witnesses, he'll have to believe it."

"Yeah." But I was thinking about how easy it had been for Ray to let suspicion fall on me.

Katie squeezed my hand. "You were right. You didn't take anything. Now everyone else will know too."

"Feels weird," I admitted. "Like I should be angrier. But mostly I just feel grateful."

"For what?"

"That you believed me. That you cared enough to investigate." I brought her hand to my lips, kissed her knuckles. "That you love me even though I'm still figuring out how to love myself."

Katie's eyes went soft. "Always."

"So what now?"

"Now we tell my father. Ray confesses or gets fired. And you get to stop being afraid of being blamed for something you didn't do."

As we drove back toward town, Katie's hand in mine, I realized maybe it could be that simple.

The truth was out. I'd said I loved her and she'd kissed me. Tomorrow, everyone would know I hadn't stolen anything.

For the first time since showing up in Meadowbrook, I let myself believe things might work out.

Maybe I deserved this after all.
