# Chapter 1: First Day Out

The '49 Ford pickup rattled under me like it might shake itself apart before I reached Meadowbrook Heights. I kept my hands steady on the wheel and told myself this was freedom. Eighteen months ago I would've believed it. Now I knew better. Freedom was conditional when Officer Brennan's voice echoed in your head with every turn: *Any screw-up, Brennan. Any violation. Three more years locked up until you're twenty-one.*

The construction site appeared around the bend—six concrete foundations poured into former farmland, lumber stacks catching early June sunlight, work trucks scattered across dirt. I pulled in next to a red Chevy with Sullivan Construction painted on the door and killed the engine. Everything I owned sat in the truck bed under canvas: two duffel bags, a box of books, tools my uncle had given me before everything went wrong. Not much to show for eighteen years, but it was mine.

I climbed out into Pennsylvania summer heat already thick at seven in the morning. The smell hit me—fresh-cut lumber and dirt, nothing like detention's institutional cleanser. I breathed it in. This was real work. A chance to prove I was more than the worst thing I'd ever done.

"You must be Alex Brennan."

The man walking toward me was built like he'd spent forty years swinging hammers—broad shoulders, calloused hands, steady gait. He wore denim work pants and a white t-shirt, measuring tape clipped to his belt. His eyes assessed me the way my uncle used to assess lumber: looking for flaws, checking if I was sound.

"Yes, sir." I kept my voice level, respectful. First impressions mattered when you had a record.

"Mike Sullivan. I run this outfit." He stuck out his hand and I shook it, his grip firm but not testing. "Officer Brennan tells me you know your way around construction work."

"Some. My uncle ran a carpentry business. I helped him before—" I stopped. Before I got arrested. "Before," I finished.

Mike nodded like he heard what I didn't say. "Well, you'll learn the rest here. We're building six ranch houses, got two months to finish them before the buyers move in. Work's hard, hours are long, and I expect everyone to pull their weight. You show up on time, work safe, do what you're told—we'll get along fine." He paused, eyes sharp on mine. "But I got zero tolerance for trouble, theft, or laziness. This clear?"

"Crystal clear, sir."

"Mike's fine. Save the sir for my father's grave." He turned toward the site, gestured for me to follow. "Come meet the crew."

Four men stood around a stack of two-by-fours, coffee cups in hand, watching us approach. They had the look of guys who'd worked together long enough to function as a unit. My arrival was an interruption, the new guy they'd have to accommodate.

"Tommy Ricci," Mike said, pointing to a guy in his mid-twenties with dark hair and an Italian last name that probably meant something in this town. "Best framer I got. You'll work with him today."

Tommy gave me a nod, eyes neutral. "You know which end of a hammer to hold?"

"Yeah, I know."

"We'll see." Not hostile, just waiting for proof.

"Ray Kowalski." Mike indicated an older guy with thinning hair and a friendly smile. "Handles roofing and anything that needs doing. Ray's been with me eight years."

"Welcome aboard," Ray said, his tone warmer than Tommy's. "Always good to have fresh blood."

The other two were Pete and Jim, guys in their thirties who'd worked construction since high school. They shook my hand with varying interest and returned to their coffee. I was the probation case Mike had hired. They'd heard about me. Officer Brennan made sure of that—full disclosure to the employer, no surprises.

"Tool shed's there," Mike pointed to a metal storage trailer at the edge of the site. "We keep everything locked. You need something, ask Tommy or me. Materials go missing, there's hell to pay."

The message was clear: Don't steal. I bit back the urge to say I'd learned that lesson. Instead, I nodded.

"Good. Tommy, get him set up with—"

A pickup truck pulled into the lot, navy blue and clean. A woman climbed out carrying a clipboard, wearing work pants that somehow looked both practical and neat. She was maybe twenty, with light brown hair pulled back and the kind of capable energy that said she knew exactly what she was doing.

"Morning, Katie," Mike called. "Brought the supply list?"

"Right here." She walked over, glanced at me once—quick assessment, nothing personal—and turned her attention to her father. Wait. Father. This was Mike Sullivan's daughter. "Lumber delivery is at nine. I confirmed with the yard. They're bringing the specialty trim you ordered for the finish work."

"Good. You meet Alex Brennan yet? Starting today."

Katie turned to me, stuck out her hand without hesitation. "Katie Sullivan. I handle logistics and scheduling for Sullivan Construction. You'll see me around."

Her handshake was firm, her eyes direct. She looked at me like I was a new crew member, not a criminal. No pity, no judgment. It caught me off guard.

"Alex. Good to meet you."

"You know carpentry?"

"Some."

"Some is better than nothing. We'll see how you do." She turned back to Mike, all efficiency. "I'll be here when the delivery comes. Need me to run anything to the hardware store this morning?"

"Not yet. Check back at lunch."

Katie nodded, made a note on her clipboard, and headed toward a small trailer that served as the site office. I watched her go—couldn't help it—and caught Tommy smirking.

"Boss's daughter," he said quietly. "Keep your eyes on the lumber."

"Wasn't—"

"Sure you weren't." Tommy handed me a hammer from the tool shed. "Come on. Let's see if you're worth the trouble Mike's taking on you."

The work started simple: framing interior walls. Tommy showed me the blueprints, explained how Mike wanted the studs placed, demonstrated keeping everything square and level. The technical side came back fast—muscle memory from summers with my uncle.

I picked up a two-by-four, checked it for straightness, measured twice, and made my cut. The saw felt good in my hands. Real. Like maybe I could do this, build something that mattered, create walls that would stand for decades after I was gone.

"Not bad," Tommy said, inspecting my work. "You weren't lying about knowing your way around tools."

"Told you."

"Yeah, well. People say a lot of things." He handed me another board. "Let's see you keep it up."

The morning blurred into physical labor—lifting, measuring, cutting, nailing. Sweat soaked through my shirt by eight-thirty. My shoulders burned by nine. I didn't care. This was real work, the kind that left you tired and satisfied. I'd spent a year in detention doing nothing, and before that wasting months with guys who called themselves friends but disappeared when police showed up. This was different. This was building something.

Katie brought water around mid-morning, distributing bottles to the crew. When she reached me, I took one and muttered thanks.

"You look like you know what you're doing with that hammer."

I glanced up, surprised. "I do."

"Good. My father doesn't hire people to stand around looking decorative." She moved on to Tommy, treating me exactly like everyone else.

I watched her walk away, clipboard in hand, coordinating the lumber delivery. She moved through the site like she owned it. The crew listened when she talked. Mike deferred to her on scheduling. She wasn't just the boss's daughter playing at business. She was the backbone holding this operation together.

"You gonna drink that water or stare at Katie all day?" Tommy's voice jolted me back.

"I'm drinking it."

"Uh-huh." Tommy grinned. "Word of advice, new guy. Katie Sullivan is smart, capable, and way out of your league. Also, Mike will bury you in one of these foundations if you even think about messing with his daughter."

"I'm not—"

"Everyone thinks about it. Just make sure thinking is all you do." He picked up his hammer. "Now get back to work before Mike decides you're dead weight."

I returned to framing walls, but Tommy's warning stuck with me. Not because I'd been thinking about Katie that way—I hadn't, not really—but because the idea of being "in someone's league" felt laughable. I was an ex-con on probation, eighteen months from maybe having a clean slate if I didn't screw up first. Katie Sullivan was a girl with a clipboard and a future, someone who belonged in the world I was just trying not to get kicked out of.

By lunch I'd framed four walls under Tommy's supervision. He inspected my work, tested the corners, checked the level. Finally, he nodded.

"You'll do. Keep this up and Mike might actually keep you around."

It shouldn't have mattered—some guy's approval on my first day. But it did. I'd spent a year being told I was worthless, a screw-up, a kid who'd never amount to anything. Having someone acknowledge I could do something right felt like water in a desert.

"Thanks."

"Don't thank me. Just keep showing up and doing the work." Tommy headed toward the cooler. "Lunch is thirty minutes. We eat here or at Callahan's Diner if you got money to spare."

I ate the sandwich I'd packed, sitting on a stack of plywood in the shade of the framed house. The crew gathered in small groups, talking about weekend plans and baseball scores. Nobody invited me over. That was fine. I wasn't here to make friends. I was here to survive eighteen months and figure out what came after.

Katie walked past carrying her lunch bag, heading toward the office trailer. She caught my eye and nodded—same casual acknowledgment she'd give anyone. I nodded back.

Maybe this could work. Maybe I could keep my head down, do the work, earn my paycheck, and get through probation without destroying everything. Maybe freedom didn't have to be fragile. Maybe second chances were real.

I almost believed it as I finished my sandwich and returned to work, hammer in hand, building walls that would stand long after I was gone.
