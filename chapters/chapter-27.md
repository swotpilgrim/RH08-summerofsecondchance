# Chapter 27: What's Next

The Monday after the celebration felt strange. No houses to finish. No urgent deadlines. Just cleanup—packing tools, returning unused materials, processing final paperwork.

"Feels weird, doesn't it?" Tommy said, loading equipment into Mike's truck. "Spent nine months building this place, now it's just done."

"Yeah." I looked at the finished houses, families already moving into two of them. "Weird but good."

Mike gathered us mid-morning with an announcement. "We're taking a few weeks before the next project starts. I've got a commercial building downtown lined up for November—library renovation. But until then, you all get time off."

Pete groaned. "Unpaid time off?"

"Paid," Mike corrected. "Core crew gets retainer pay for downtime. That's you, Tommy, Pete, Joe, Carl, and Alex. Two weeks at half rate. Consider it a thank-you for good work."

My chest went tight. Paid time off. Like a real job with real benefits, not just day labor that ended when the work ran out.

"Enjoy it," Mike continued. "Spend time with family. Rest up. We hit the library project hard come November."

The crew scattered. Tommy made plans to visit his family in Philadelphia. Pete and Joe were heading to a Steelers game. Carl had a deck to build at his own house.

And I had... nothing. No plans. No structure. No schedule telling me where to be and when.

For the first time in nearly two years, I had completely unstructured time.

It should've felt good. Instead, it felt terrifying.

Katie found me in the construction office that afternoon, staring at a calendar like it held answers.

"What are you doing?" she asked.

"Trying to figure out what people do with free time."

She laughed. "You're serious."

"Detention had a schedule for everything. Probation had requirements and check-ins. This job had hours and deadlines. I don't—" I gestured helplessly. "I don't know how to just have free time."

Katie's expression softened. She sat beside me, took the calendar away.

"We're going to figure it out together," she said. "What do you want to do? Not what you think you should do. What sounds fun?"

I thought about it. "I've never been to a movie theater. Not since before Mom died."

"Then we'll go to the movies." Katie pulled out her own small calendar. "What else?"

"Just—normal things. Things regular people do when they're not working or serving time or trying not to screw up."

"Okay." Katie started writing. "Movies. Walks in the park. Maybe a picnic if the weather holds. We could drive to Pittsburgh one day, look around the city. Just be normal for a while."

Normal. The word felt foreign. But also appealing.

"Yeah," I said. "Let's do that."

We went to the movies Tuesday night. The theater was small—Meadowbrook only had one—showing "Rebel Without a Cause." I bought tickets and popcorn, and we sat in the back row like teenagers sneaking around.

The movie was about a kid from a good family making bad choices, and I couldn't help seeing myself in the wrong direction—I'd been the bad kid trying to make good choices.

Katie held my hand through the whole film. When James Dean's character died at the end, she squeezed my fingers.

"You're not him," she whispered.

"I know." And I did. I'd made different choices. Better ones.

Wednesday we walked through Riverside Park in full daylight. No hiding, no sneaking around. Just a couple taking a walk, holding hands, talking about nothing important. Katie pointed out birds. I noticed which trees were starting to turn.

"This is nice," I said.

"What is?"

"This. Normal. No drama, no crisis, just being together."

"Get used to it," Katie said. "This is what life looks like when you're not running from demons."

Thursday we had a picnic by Stony Creek. Katie packed sandwiches and Beth contributed cookies. We spread a blanket on the grass and watched clouds drift past.

"You're different," Katie observed.

"Different how?"

"Lighter. Like you're not carrying as much weight." She rolled onto her side to look at me. "You're learning to be happy."

"Maybe." I pulled her closer. "You make it easier."

"Good." She kissed me, long and sweet. "That's my job."

Friday, Beth found us at Callahan's Diner sharing a milkshake like some fifties cliché.

"You two are disgusting," she announced, sliding into the booth beside Katie.

"We're adorable," Katie corrected.

"Disgustingly adorable." But Beth was grinning. "Just wanted to say—I'm glad you stuck around, Alex. Katie's been humming while doing dishes. It's disturbing but nice."

"I don't hum," Katie protested.

"You absolutely do." Beth stole a fry from Katie's plate. "Also, Dad wants to know if you're coming to Sunday dinner, Alex. He's making pot roast."

"Your father invited me to dinner?"

"He invites you every week," Beth said. "You've just been too stupid to notice. So I'm making it explicit: Sunday, five o'clock, bring your appetite. And maybe flowers for Katie so she stops sighing dramatically over you."

"I don't sigh dramatically!"

"You really do," I said. Katie smacked my arm, but she was smiling.

Mrs. Callahan appeared with two slices of pie. "On the house," she said. "For the cutest couple in Meadowbrook."

"We're not—" I started.

"Yes, you are," Mrs. Callahan interrupted. "And it's about time this town had something happy to talk about instead of just gossip and judgment. You two are good for each other. Good for this whole town, showing people that second chances work when you actually give them properly."

She walked away before I could respond, leaving us with free pie and the warmth of community approval.

"We're approved by Mrs. Callahan," Katie said solemnly. "That's bigger than a marriage license in Meadowbrook."

I laughed—actually laughed—and dug into the pie.

Saturday morning, Mike showed up at my room above the office with fishing rods.

"Ever been fishing?" he asked.

"No, sir."

"Good. Time you learned." He jerked his thumb toward his truck. "Let's go."

We drove to a pond outside town, set up on the bank with poles and tackle boxes. Mike showed me how to bait the hook, cast the line, wait with patience.

"Fishing's not really about catching fish," he said after twenty minutes of silence. "It's about having an excuse to sit still and think."

"What are you thinking about?"

"You, mostly." Mike adjusted his line. "How different you are from nine months ago. How you've become someone I'd trust with my business, my crew, my daughter."

I didn't know what to say to that.

"I'm proud of you, Alex." Mike's voice was gruff. "Proud of the man you're becoming. The choices you're making. The way you show up every day and do the work—not just construction work, but the work of being better."

My throat went tight. "Thank you. That means a lot."

"Ellen would've liked you," Mike said. "She had a gift for seeing potential in people, for believing they could be more than their worst mistakes. She'd see what I see—a young man building a good life despite a rough start."

"I wish I could've met her."

"Me too." Mike reeled in his line, cast it again. "But you've got Katie, and Katie's got her mother's heart. That belief in second chances, that ability to see past surface to who someone really is. So in a way, you are connected to Ellen. Through Katie."

We sat in comfortable silence while the sun climbed higher and the pond reflected clouds like glass.

"Can I ask you something?" I said finally.

"Shoot."

"How do you stop waiting for things to fall apart? How do you just... believe it's going to be okay?"

Mike considered this. "You don't stop waiting entirely. Life's uncertain. Things go wrong. Ellen died without warning, and I'll never fully stop bracing for disaster. But you learn to trust anyway. Trust yourself, trust the people around you, trust that even if things go wrong, you'll handle it."

"I'm trying to learn that."

"I know you are." Mike glanced at me. "That's what makes the difference. Trying. Showing up. Choosing to believe even when you're scared. That's courage, Alex. Real courage."

A fish tugged at my line, and Mike coached me through reeling it in. Small bass, barely worth keeping. We threw it back and watched it disappear into the brown water.

"Thanks for this," I said. "For everything. The job, the teaching, trusting me with Katie."

"You earned all of it," Mike said. "Now let's catch some actual fish so we're not lying when we tell Katie we went fishing."

We stayed until noon, caught three keeper-sized bass, and drove back with the truck smelling like pond water and accomplishment.

Sunday dinner at the Sullivan house was loud and warm. Beth teased. Mike told construction stories. Katie's hand found mine under the table, and nobody seemed to think it was strange that I was there, like I belonged.

Like I was family.

After dinner, I helped Katie with dishes while Beth and Mike argued over the radio—she wanted rock and roll, he wanted news.

"This is what I wanted to show you," Katie said quietly, handing me a plate to dry. "Normal life. Family dinners. Lazy weekends. Just existing without crisis or drama."

"I like it," I admitted. "Scared me at first—all this unstructured time. But I'm learning to like it."

"Good." Katie kissed my cheek. "Because this is what our life's going to look like. Work and rest and family dinners and fishing trips and being beautifully, wonderfully boring together."

"I can't wait," I said. And meant it.

Through the kitchen window, I could see the street where I'd parked my truck. The evening was cooling, leaves starting to turn, summer fading into fall.

Nine months ago, I'd shown up in Meadowbrook planning to keep my head down and run. Now I had Katie, Mike's respect, Tommy's friendship. Mrs. Callahan's approval and Beth's grudging affection. A job waiting for me, a future to build, a community that knew my past but saw my present more clearly.

I had a life worth living.

And for the first time, I was learning to simply live it instead of waiting for permission or for disaster.

That was the real gift of these weeks off—not the rest, but learning that I was allowed to rest. Allowed to enjoy things. Allowed to be happy without waiting for it to be taken away.

I was learning to be normal.

And normal felt pretty damn good.
