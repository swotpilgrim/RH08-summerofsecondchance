# Chapter 6: Staying Late

The crew packed up at four-thirty Wednesday. Tommy told me to call it a day—we'd framed three walls and the heat was brutal. But I'd noticed something wrong with the wall I'd built that morning. Quarter-inch off plumb. Close enough that most guys would leave it. But close enough wasn't right.

"I'm gonna stay. Fix something."

He looked at the wall, tested it with his level, shrugged. "Looks fine."

"It's off. Quarter-inch."

Tommy nodded slowly. "Your call. Lock up when you're done. Key's in the office."

The crew left, dust rising from the lot. I stood alone in the framed house watching shadows lengthen. The wall mocked me—close but not perfect. In detention, close enough was the standard. Out here, I wanted different standards.

I pulled my hammer and started removing nails. The wall came down board by board. I checked the bottom plate—there was the problem, slight variance that threw everything off. I reset it, checked it three times. Plumb. Then I rebuilt the wall, measuring each placement, testing every joint. The physical work felt good—fixing what I'd gotten wrong. Sweat soaked through my shirt. I didn't care. This was how you got better.

The sun dropped toward the horizon. I worked in the changing light, focused on precision.

"You planning to work all night?"

Katie's voice startled me. I looked up and found her in the doorway, silhouetted against sunset, carrying two Cokes.

"Just fixing something."

"What needed fixing?" She walked across the rough floor, careful of nails. "Tommy said everything looked good when they left."

"This wall was off. Quarter-inch."

Katie checked the wall with her tape. "It's perfect now."

"It wasn't before."

"So you stayed late to rebuild it?" She sat on lumber, studied me with that direct gaze. "Most guys would've left it."

"Most guys aren't one violation from going back to detention." The words came out sharp. I softened my tone. "I need the work to be right. Not just good enough."

Katie held out a Coke. I took it, grateful. Cold and wet, perfect against the heat.

"My father was right about you."

"What'd he say?"

"That you care about the work. Not just completing it, but doing it well. He said caring makes the difference between builders and carpenters."

I drank and let that settle. Mike thought I was a carpenter. Someone who cared about craft.

"He's a good teacher," I said.

"He is. But you can't teach someone to care. That's something they bring themselves." Katie sipped her own Coke, watching the sunset paint the framed houses in shades of orange and pink. "How'd you learn framing? Before this job, I mean."

"My uncle. Summers when I was fourteen, fifteen. He ran a carpentry business. He'd show me techniques, explain why things mattered." The memories were bittersweet. "He taught me to check square, measure twice, care about precision."

"What happened? Why'd you stop?"

I hesitated. Katie waited, patient. The construction site felt private in the fading light, removed from judgment. Like honesty was safe.

"I got stupid. Started running with guys who didn't care about building anything. My uncle said I was wasting my potential. I thought he didn't understand. So I stopped showing up." I finished the Coke, set it down carefully. "By the time I realized he was right, I was in handcuffs."

Katie just listened. Like my past was information, not judgment.

"You're here now. Building things again. That counts."

"Does it? Or am I just doing what I'm told until I can leave?"

"Is that your plan? Leave when you're free?"

I didn't answer. A month ago the answer would've been simple: yes, leave Meadowbrook the second I could. But now there was this job I was good at, this crew accepting me, this room that felt like home. Mike teaching me. Tommy backing me up. Katie bringing Coke at sunset and believing I was more than my mistakes.

"I don't know," I admitted. "Staying means risking that I'll screw up, that everyone will remember I'm the ex-con who doesn't belong here. Leaving means walking away from the first place I've felt like maybe I could belong."

"Belonging is scary."

"Yeah."

Katie stood, walked to the wall I'd rebuilt. She tested it, checked the level. "You rebuilt this entire wall because it was quarter-inch off. Stayed late on your own time to make it perfect, not because anyone was watching, but because it mattered to you." She turned. "That's not someone just doing what he's told. That's someone who cares."

"Caring about work is safe. It's caring about other things that's dangerous."

"What other things?"

The question hung in the air between us. I could deflect, make a joke, keep the walls up. That was safer. But Katie had shared her grief about her mother, her lost dreams of architecture school, her guilt about wanting something for herself. She'd been honest with me. Maybe I owed her the same.

"People," I said quietly. "Caring about people means they can disappoint you. Or you can disappoint them. Either way someone gets hurt."

"That's life. Disappointment happens. So does connection, loyalty, love. You can't have one without risking the other."

"In detention, not caring was survival. Don't make friends. Don't trust authority. Don't want things because wanting makes you vulnerable." I picked up my hammer. "Those habits are hard to break."

Katie crossed to me, close enough I could smell her shampoo. "You're not in detention anymore. You keep saying that, but I don't think you believe it. You're still living like you're one mistake from losing everything."

"I am one mistake from losing everything."

"No. You're one mistake from having to work harder. That's different." Her voice was firm but gentle. "Mike isn't waiting for you to screw up. Tommy isn't looking for reasons to distrust you. We're not your jailors. We're people who want you to succeed."

The honesty in her voice made my chest tight. I wanted to believe her. Wanted to trust that belonging here was possible, that I could care about this work and these people without it all falling apart.

"What about you?" I asked, deflecting because direct honesty felt too raw. "You said you care about your father's business but wonder when you're allowed to care about your own dreams. What'd you mean?"

Katie's expression shifted—surprise and reluctance. But fair was fair.

"I've been managing the business for two years. Supply orders, scheduling, permits, paperwork. I'm good at it. But it's not what I want to do forever."

"Architecture school."

"Yeah. Full scholarship to University of Pennsylvania. Then my mother died and everything stopped mattering except keeping my father and Beth from falling apart. Architecture school felt selfish when my family needed me."

"It's not selfish to have dreams."

"Isn't it? My father was grieving, barely functioning. Beth was devastated. Someone had to hold everything together."

Katie sat back down, shoulders slumped. "Two years later, the scholarship's gone. My father's better but depends on me. Beth's seventeen but needs stability. I'm twenty managing a construction business instead of learning to design buildings. When exactly am I supposed to pursue my dreams? What's the appropriate time before wanting something stops being selfish?"

The pain in her voice mirrored my own struggle. Neither of us knew how to want more without guilt.

"You should apply again. Next year."

"Maybe I will." Katie didn't sound convinced. "Maybe we both should figure out what we actually want instead of living in limbo—you waiting for probation to end, me waiting for permission to want something."

Dusk had given way to darkness. Stars appeared overhead. The site felt like its own world, separate from Meadowbrook's judgments.

"I want to be good at this," I said, gesturing at the framed houses. "Learn from Mike until I know the trade inside out. Build houses that stand for fifty years. I want people to trust my work." I paused. "I want to deserve second chances instead of just serving time."

Katie smiled, the real kind. "Those are good wants. Hold onto them."

We sat in comfortable silence as full dark settled. The Coke bottles sat empty beside us. My rebuilt wall stood straight and true, exactly as it should be. For the first time since getting out of detention, I felt like maybe I was building toward something instead of just running from the past.

"Thank you," I said. "For the Coke. For listening."

"You're welcome." Katie stood, brushed off her pants. "Come on. I'll wait while you lock up. Then you're going home to get some rest. Tomorrow's going to be hot and Mike wants to start early."

I gathered my tools, checked the site, locked the office with the key Tommy had mentioned. Katie's truck idled in the parking lot, headlights cutting through darkness. She waited until I started my Ford before driving away.

I sat in the truck watching the construction site disappear in my rearview mirror, thinking about walls rebuilt correctly and dreams deferred too long and caring about things even when it scared you.

Maybe Katie was right. Maybe I wasn't in detention anymore and it was time to start living like it.
