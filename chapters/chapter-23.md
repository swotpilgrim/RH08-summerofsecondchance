# Chapter 23: The Honest Conversation

We walked in silence through the cooling evening. Katie led the way, hands in her sweater pockets, and I followed half a step behind. Not touching. Not talking. Just walking.

She took us to Riverside Park, to the willow trees by Stony Creek where we'd sat weeks ago talking about being stuck and scared and wanting things we didn't think we deserved.

Katie settled onto the wooden footbridge, legs dangling over the water. I sat beside her, leaving space between us that felt like a canyon.

"So," Katie said finally. "Talk."

I took a breath. Let it out. Started.

"I'm terrified," I said. "Of staying. Of screwing this up. Of being exactly what everyone warned you about—the ex-con who disappoints you, who brings trouble, who can't escape his past."

Katie didn't interrupt, just watched the water flowing beneath us.

"When Ray stole those tools and let everyone suspect me, it proved what I already knew," I continued. "That I'll always be the first suspect. That my record will follow me everywhere. That no matter how hard I work or how much I try, I'll never be just Alex. I'll always be Alex the ex-con."

"Is that really what you're afraid of?" Katie asked quietly. "Being suspected when something goes wrong?"

"Part of it."

"What's the rest?"

I forced myself to look at her. "I'm afraid of wanting this. Wanting you. Wanting a future here. Because every good thing I've ever had got taken away. My mom died. My so-called friends disappeared when I got arrested. Detention taught me not to want things because wanting things just means losing them."

Katie's expression softened, but she didn't speak.

"And then I came here," I said. "Met you. Started building something real. Started wanting things again. Started believing maybe I could have a future. And that terrifies me, Katie. Because if I let myself want this—want you—and then I lose it?" I shook my head. "I don't think I'd survive that."

"So instead you were going to leave first," Katie said. "Control the losing by being the one who walks away."

"Yeah." The admission felt like pulling out my own ribs. "I know that's messed up. I know I hurt you by pushing you away. But I didn't know what else to do. Didn't know how to want something this much and not be terrified of losing it."

Katie was quiet for a long moment, looking at the creek flowing past in the dim light.

"I'm afraid too," she said finally.

I turned to look at her.

"I'm afraid of wanting architecture school while my father still needs help," Katie continued. "Afraid of pursuing my dreams and failing. Afraid of being selfish by wanting something for myself instead of just taking care of everyone else." Her voice went soft. "And I'm afraid of loving you. Afraid of losing you the way I lost my mother—suddenly, without warning, before I was ready."

"Katie—"

"My mother died in the kitchen making dinner," Katie said. "One minute she was fine, laughing about something Beth said. The next minute she was on the floor and nothing we did mattered. She was just gone." Tears slipped down her cheeks. "I learned that people you love can disappear in a heartbeat. That wanting them, loving them, building your life around them doesn't mean you get to keep them."

I wanted to reach for her but didn't know if I had the right.

"So yeah," Katie said. "I understand being afraid. I understand not wanting to want things because wanting means risking loss. I get it, Alex. I really do."

"Then how do you do it?" I asked. "How do you keep wanting things? Keep trying? Keep believing it won't all fall apart?"

Katie looked at me then, eyes bright with tears. "Because being afraid doesn't mean you stop living. Being afraid doesn't mean you stop wanting things or loving people or building a future. It just means you find the courage to try anyway."

"I don't know if I have that courage."

"Yes, you do." Katie finally reached for my hand. "You showed up in Meadowbrook alone and scared. You worked hard every day even when people suspected you. You told me you loved me even though it terrified you. That's courage, Alex. That's what courage looks like."

Her hand was warm in mine. Real. Solid.

"I love you," Katie said. "I love you so much it scares me. But I can't love you hard enough for both of us. I can't believe in you enough for both of us. You have to believe you deserve love too. You have to believe you deserve happiness and a future and good things."

"I'm trying," I said hoarsely. "When I'm with you, I almost believe it. Almost believe I deserve this."

"That's a start." Katie squeezed my hand. "That's all I'm asking—that you try. That you keep showing up. That you stop running from the only thing you actually want."

"What if I mess up? What if I disappoint you?"

"Then we deal with it together." Katie's voice was fierce. "That's what people who love each other do. They mess up and forgive and try again. They don't run away the first time things get hard."

I thought about that. About staying. About trying. About building something with Katie that might last or might fall apart but at least we'd have tried.

"What do you want, Alex?" Katie asked. "Not what you're afraid of. Not what you think you deserve. What do you actually want?"

I looked at her—at Katie with her tear-streaked face and fierce eyes and hand holding mine like an anchor—and told her the truth.

"I want to stay in Meadowbrook," I said. "I want to learn the trade from your father. Get my contractor's license someday. Build things that last—houses people live in, structures that matter." I took a shaking breath. "I want to wake up every morning and drive to work knowing I belong there. Want to have Sunday dinner with people who actually want me around. Want to stop waiting for permission to be happy."

"And?" Katie prompted.

"And I want you." The words came easier now. "I want to sit on this bridge fifty years from now and remind you about the summer we met. Want to support you while you're in architecture school. Want to build houses from your designs. Want to fight about stupid things and make up and fight again and make up again. Want—" My voice cracked. "I want everything, Katie. With you. If you'll give me another chance."

Katie's smile broke through her tears like sunrise. "You already have it. You've always had it."

She leaned forward and kissed me.

Not tentative. Not questioning. Just sure. Real. Like she'd made her choice and wasn't taking it back.

I kissed her back, pulling her closer, one hand tangling in her hair. She tasted like salt from tears and something sweet, and kissing her felt like coming home after being lost for eighteen years.

When we broke apart, both breathing hard, Katie rested her forehead against mine.

"I choose you," she said. "I chose you weeks ago. The question was whether you'd choose yourself."

"I'm choosing," I said. "I'm terrified and I don't know what I'm doing, but I'm choosing. Choosing to stay. Choosing to try. Choosing you."

"That's all I needed to hear." Katie kissed me again, briefer this time. "Now we just have to do the work."

"What work?"

"The work of building a life together." She pulled back to look at me. "The work of you believing you deserve happiness. The work of me believing it's okay to want things for myself. The work of both of us being scared and doing it anyway."

"That sounds hard."

"It probably will be," Katie agreed. "But I think we can handle it. One day at a time, right?"

One day at a time. The same way I'd survived detention. The same way I'd gotten through nine months of probation. The same way I'd learned crown molding and finish carpentry.

Maybe building a future worked the same way. One day, one choice, one moment of courage at a time.

"Yeah," I said. "One day at a time."

We sat on the bridge as full darkness settled, holding hands, watching the creek flow past. Fireflies rose from the grass, blinking gold in the night. Somewhere a dog barked. The summer air smelled like water and growing things.

"Tell me about the cabinets you were building today," Katie said.

So I did. Told her about the custom work for house six, the measurements and joints and how the grain of the wood determined how you cut it. She asked questions, real questions, interested in the details. And I realized this was what I wanted—this easy conversation with someone who actually cared about my work, my thoughts, my life.

"You're good at this," Katie said. "Building things. Creating things that last."

"I'm learning."

"You're better than you think." She leaned her head on my shoulder. "I'm proud of you, you know. For coming to the house tonight. For having this conversation. For choosing to stay."

The words made my chest warm. "Thank you for giving me another chance."

"Always." Katie lifted her head to look at me. "But Alex? This is the last time I chase you down. From now on, when you're scared or doubting or thinking about running, you come talk to me. Deal?"

"Deal."

"Good." She stood up, pulled me to my feet. "Come on. Walk me home before my father sends out a search party."

We walked back through Riverside Park hand in hand. At her front door, Katie turned to face me.

"See you Monday?" she asked.

"I'll be there."

"Good." She kissed me one more time, quick and sweet. "And Alex? I love you."

"I love you too," I said, and this time the words felt like a promise instead of a risk.

Katie went inside, and I walked back to my truck with something light blooming in my chest.

Hope.

Real hope, not the desperate kind I'd been clinging to, but the solid kind that said maybe—just maybe—I was building something that would last.

I'd chosen to stay.

Chosen to try.

Chosen Katie and this life and the terrifying possibility of happiness.

Now I just had to keep choosing it, one day at a time, until choosing became second nature.

Until staying felt more natural than running.

Until I finally believed I deserved what I'd been building all along.
