# Chapter 17: Katie's Faith

I spent the next two days working like a machine. Seven to five. Spoke when spoken to. Kept my head down. The crew gave me awkward, careful space that felt worse than hostility.

Tommy tried to talk to me Wednesday. I told him I was fine and moved to eat alone.

Katie stayed away. I saw her truck come and go, but she didn't seek me out. Part of me was grateful. Part of me felt her absence like a missing limb.

Thursday evening, the crew cleared out early. Mike left around four.

I should've left too. Instead, I stayed to finish the baseboard in the master bedroom. Really, I just didn't want to face another evening alone with my thoughts.

The sun was starting to sink when I heard footsteps on the plywood subfloor behind me.

"We need to talk," Katie said.

I didn't turn around, just kept measuring the next piece of baseboard. "Not much to talk about."

"Alex." Her voice had an edge to it I'd never heard before. "Put down the saw and look at me."

I set down the measuring tape and turned. She stood in the bedroom doorway, arms crossed, and the expression on her face made my chest tight. Not pity. Not even sympathy.

Fury.

"What's wrong?" I asked, stupid question when she was clearly about to tell me.

"You," she said, stepping into the room. "You're what's wrong. Working yourself to exhaustion, refusing to talk to anyone, shutting down like some kind of—" She gestured, searching for words. "Like you've already given up."

"I haven't given up. I'm still here, aren't I? Still working."

"Are you?" She moved closer, and I could see the anger bright in her eyes. "Because the Alex I know doesn't hide in empty rooms during lunch. The Alex I know doesn't quit when things get hard."

Something hot flared in my chest. "Maybe you don't know me as well as you think."

"Don't." She pointed a finger at me, sharp as any nail I'd driven. "Don't you dare use that excuse. Don't pretend you're some mystery I can't understand when what I'm seeing is plain as day."

"And what's that?"

"You're running." Katie's voice rose. "Not physically, but you're running away from this, from the crew, from my father, from me. You're letting what happened Monday define everything instead of fighting back."

"Fighting back how?" The words came out harsher than I meant them. "They searched my room, Katie. Went through my things because everyone assumed I was the thief. What am I supposed to fight?"

"The assumption!" She slapped her palm against the wall stud, the crack of sound making me flinch. "You're supposed to fight the assumption by proving them wrong, by showing up and working hard and being exactly who I know you are."

"And who's that?" I asked. "The ex-con? The kid on probation?"

"The man who's been showing up every day for nine months," Katie said. "The one who stayed late to fix his mistakes. The one who—" Her voice cracked. "The one who made me believe second chances were real."

I had to look away.

"Katie, you don't understand—"

"Stop telling me I don't understand!" She moved into my line of sight. "I understand you've been treated like garbage. I understand you've got a record that follows you. I understand it's not fair. But that doesn't mean you get to give up."

"You think I'm using my record as an excuse?"

"I think you're scared," Katie said, softer but fierce. "Terrified of staying and building something real. So you're pushing everyone away before they can reject you first."

I stopped. Couldn't deny it when part of me recognized the truth.

"My mother used to say something," Katie said quietly. "She said people become what they tell themselves they are. If you keep telling yourself you're just an ex-con who'll never be trusted, that's exactly what you'll be. Not because it's true, but because you'll make it true by giving up."

I turned back to my measuring tape, picked it up with hands that weren't quite steady. "Your mother sounds like she was a wise woman."

"She was." Katie's voice held old grief, still sharp. "And she believed in second chances. Believed people could choose who they wanted to be instead of letting circumstances choose for them."

"Some circumstances don't give you much choice."

"Bullshit."

The word stopped me cold. I'd never heard Katie curse before.

"You have choices, Alex. You had a choice Monday when they wanted to search your room—you could've refused, could've walked away, but you didn't. You chose to let them search because you knew you were innocent." She moved closer. "You have a choice now. You can keep acting like a man who's already condemned, or you can be the man I've watched for nine months. The one who shows up. Who works hard. Who cares about doing things right."

"Why do you care so much?" The question came out rawer than I intended.

Katie went very still. The evening light coming through the unfinished window turned her hair golden, caught the dust motes floating between us.

"Because I believe in you," she said finally. "My father believes in you. Even Tommy believes in you, and he doesn't trust easy. But none of that matters if you don't believe in yourself."

"Katie—"

"I'm falling in love with you."

The words hung in the air between us like something physical. Real. Terrifying.

I forgot how to breathe.

"I'm falling in love with you," she said again, stronger this time. "And I need you to fight for yourself the way I'm fighting for you. I need you to see what I see—someone worth believing in. Someone who deserves more than running away when things get hard."

I wanted to say something. Wanted to tell her I was falling for her too, had been since the first time she handed me coffee and treated me like I was worth more than my record. Wanted to tell her she was the best thing that had happened to me since I got out, maybe the best thing that had ever happened to me.

But the words caught in my throat, trapped behind years of believing I didn't deserve good things. Didn't deserve someone like her.

"Say something," Katie whispered.

"I don't—" I stopped. Started again. "I don't know how to be what you think I am."

"You already are what I think you are." She stepped closer, close enough that I could see the tears gathering in her eyes. "You just have to stop running from it."

"I'm scared." The admission felt like pulling out my own ribs. "I'm scared of staying and screwing up. Scared of wanting this and losing it. Scared of—" I gestured helplessly. "Of all of it."

"I know." Her voice gentled. "I'm scared too. But being scared isn't a good enough reason to stop living. To stop trying. To stop letting people in."

"What if I disappoint you?"

"What if you don't?" Katie reached out and took my hand, her fingers warm against mine. "What if you stay and work hard and prove to yourself what everyone else already sees?"

Her touch made my chest ache. Made me want things I'd spent eighteen years convincing myself were out of reach.

"I don't know if I can," I said honestly.

"Yes, you can." Katie squeezed my hand. "You've been doing it for nine months. One day at a time, remember? You said that once. One nail at a time, one board at a time, one day at a time."

I had said that. Standing in this same house, talking about how I got through detention by breaking time into manageable pieces.

"One day at a time," I repeated.

"Starting with tomorrow," Katie said. "Show up. Work hard. Stop hiding from the crew. Stop hiding from me. Just show up and be yourself."

"And if something else goes wrong? If they suspect me again?"

"Then we deal with it together." Her eyes were steady on mine. "You don't have to face everything alone anymore. That's what I'm trying to tell you."

Together. The word felt foreign. Dangerous. Like something I wasn't allowed to have.

"Katie, I—" The words lodged in my throat again. I love you. I love you and I'm terrified and I don't know how to be the person you think I am. "I don't know what to say."

She smiled, small and sad. "You don't have to say anything right now. Just promise me you'll stop giving up. Promise me you'll keep trying."

"I'll try." It was all I could offer. "I can't promise I won't mess up, but I'll try."

"That's all I'm asking." Katie let go of my hand, and the loss of her touch felt like winter. "I should go. My father's expecting me for dinner."

She turned to leave, and panic clawed at my ribs. "Katie."

She stopped in the doorway, looked back.

"Thank you," I said. "For believing in me. Even when I don't."

Her smile turned real then, warm enough to cut through the cooling evening. "Always. Even when you're being stubborn and stupid and breaking my heart by pushing me away."

"I'll do better," I said.

"I know you will." She paused. "And Alex? When you're ready to say what you wanted to say just now? I'll be here."

Then she was gone, her footsteps fading across the plywood, leaving me standing in an unfinished bedroom with her words echoing in my head.

I'm falling in love with you.

I pressed my palms against my eyes, took a shaking breath. She loved me. Katie Sullivan loved me.

And I loved her.

God help me, I loved her.

But saying it out loud felt like jinxing it. Like admitting I wanted something good and watching it get taken away.

One day at a time, she'd said. Show up and keep trying.

I could do that.

I picked up my measuring tape and went back to work. But my hands were steadier now. My chest felt lighter.

Katie believed in me.

Maybe that was enough to build on.
