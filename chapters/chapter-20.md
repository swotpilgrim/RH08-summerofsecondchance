# Chapter 20: Crisis - Walking Away

Friday arrived with Ray gone, the tools returned to the shed with a note of apology Mike read and then tore up. The crew moved through the day with lighter steps, tension lifted. Even the work felt easier—like a weight had been removed from all of us.

I should've felt relieved. Should've celebrated being cleared, being trusted, being believed.

Instead, I felt the old familiar itch under my skin. The one that said to run before everything fell apart.

Katie found me after work, sitting in my truck with the engine off, staring at nothing.

"You're doing it again," she said, leaning against the driver's door.

"Doing what?"

"Hiding. Planning your escape route." She crossed her arms. "I can see it on your face."

I couldn't lie to her. Didn't want to. "This whole thing with Ray—"

"Proved you were innocent," Katie interrupted. "Proved everyone who suspected you was wrong."

"This time." I gripped the steering wheel. "But what about next time? What about when something else goes wrong and I'm still the guy with the record?"

"So you're thinking about quitting." It wasn't a question.

"I'm thinking maybe I should. Before—" I stopped.

"Before what?" Katie's voice went sharp. "Before you build something you care about? Before you prove you belong here? Before you let yourself be happy?"

"Before I cost your father his business." The words came out harsh. "Katie, I'm a liability. Always will be. First suspect, first blame, first—"

"Stop." She yanked open the truck door. "Get out."

"What?"

"Get out of the truck, Alex. If you're going to do this, you're going to look me in the eye."

I climbed out, and Katie stepped back, arms still crossed, eyes blazing.

"You're doing exactly what I was afraid of," she said. "Using this as an excuse to run. To avoid building a real life here."

"It's not an excuse, it's reality—"

"Bullshit." The word cracked like a whip. "You were cleared. Everyone apologized. My father trusts you. The crew trusts you. But that's not enough because you're terrified."

"Of course I'm terrified!" The admission burst out of me. "Katie, I'm terrified that I'll mess this up. That something will happen and everyone will remember I'm the ex-con and all of this—" I gestured between us, toward the job site. "All of this will disappear."

"So instead of fighting for it, you're going to walk away first." Katie's voice turned cold. "That's what you do, isn't it? When things get hard, when you're scared, you shut down and plan your exit."

"That's not fair."

"Isn't it?" She stepped closer, eyes fierce. "Ray's gone. You're cleared. You could finally relax, finally believe you have a future here. But instead you're already planning to leave because you're convinced the next disaster is coming."

"Because it always does!" The words tore out of me. "Katie, good things don't happen to guys like me. They don't last. And I'd rather leave now while I still can than wait around for it all to fall apart."

"You want to know the difference between you and Ray?" Katie asked quietly.

"What?"

"Ray made actual mistakes and kept digging deeper. You're punishing yourself for mistakes you haven't even made yet. For disasters that exist only in your head." She shook her head. "You're a coward, Alex."

The word hit like a fist. "I'm trying to protect you—"

"I don't need protection!" Katie's voice rose. "I need you to stop using your past as an excuse to run from the future. I need you to fight for yourself, for us, for the life you could have here."

"And what if I can't?" The question came out broken. "What if I don't know how to stop waiting for everything to fall apart?"

"Then you figure it out," Katie said. "You learn. You try. But you don't run away because it's easier than being afraid."

"Katie—"

"I love you," she said, and tears shone in her eyes now. "I love you so much it terrifies me. But I can't fight your demons for you. I can't convince you that you deserve happiness if you don't believe it yourself."

The words felt like they were pulling my chest apart.

"You have a choice," Katie continued. "Stay here and build a life. Build a future. Build something real with me. Or keep running from your past forever, too scared to grab onto anything good because you might lose it."

"I don't know how to choose that," I admitted. "I don't know how to believe it won't all disappear."

Katie's expression cracked, pain bleeding through the anger. "Then I guess we're done here."

"Katie, wait—"

"No." She stepped back. "I'm done trying to convince you that you're worth more than your worst mistake. I'm done fighting for us when you won't fight for yourself. You want to leave? Leave. But don't pretend it's to protect me or anyone else. You're doing this because you're too scared to stay."

She turned and walked away, and I couldn't make myself call her back.

Because maybe she was right.

Maybe I was a coward.

Officer Brennan showed up for our weekly check-in that evening, finding me in my room above the office, packing a duffel bag I'd pulled from under the bed.

"Going somewhere?" he asked from the doorway.

I shoved a shirt into the bag. "Just organizing."

Brennan stepped inside, closed the door behind him. "Try again."

I sat on the bed, the duffel between my knees. "I'm thinking about leaving when probation ends. Five months left. Then I'm free to go anywhere."

"Free to go, or running away?"

"What's the difference?"

"Intent." Brennan pulled up the single chair in the room, sat down. "Are you running from something or toward something?"

The question stopped me. I opened my mouth. Closed it.

"That's what I thought," Brennan said. "So what happened? Last I checked, you were doing good here. Job going well, staying out of trouble, even found yourself a girl if Mrs. Callahan's gossip is to be believed."

"That's the problem." I stared at my hands. "Things are good. Too good. And I keep waiting for it to fall apart."

"So you're gonna make sure it falls apart by leaving first."

"That's what Katie said."

"Smart girl." Brennan leaned back. "You know how many of my cases actually make it, Alex? Actually turn their lives around instead of cycling back through the system?"

"How many?"

"Maybe one in ten. Most of them talk a good game, but when it comes down to it, they're too scared to actually build something new. Easier to go back to what they know, even if what they know is destructive."

"I'm not going back to stealing cars."

"No, but you're doing something just as destructive," Brennan said. "You're throwing away everything you've built here because you're convinced you don't deserve it."

I didn't have an answer for that.

"Let me ask you something," Brennan continued. "What do you actually want? Not what you think you should want, not what scares you less. What do you want?"

I thought about Katie's smile. Mike's gruff approval. Tommy's casual friendship. The satisfaction of finishing a piece of trim work perfectly, knowing it would last.

"I want to stay," I admitted quietly. "I want to learn the trade from Mike. Get my contractor's license someday. Build things that last. I want—" My throat went tight. "I want Katie. Want a future with her."

"So why are you packing a bag?"

"Because I'm terrified I'll mess it up." The words came out raw. "I'm terrified something will go wrong and I'll prove everyone right about me. That I'll disappoint Katie. That I'll—"

"That you'll be human," Brennan interrupted. "That you'll make mistakes like every other person on the planet."

"My mistakes have consequences."

"Everyone's mistakes have consequences." Brennan leaned forward, elbows on his knees. "The difference is whether you learn from them or let them define you forever."

I stared at the duffel bag, at the few belongings I'd shoved inside. Everything I owned, ready to run.

"I don't know how to stop being afraid," I said.

"You don't have to stop being afraid," Brennan said. "You just have to stop letting fear make your decisions. Big difference."

"What if I stay and it all falls apart anyway?"

"What if you leave and spend the rest of your life wondering what might've been?" Brennan stood up. "Look, I can't make this choice for you. But I'll tell you what I see: I see a kid who's done the work, put in the time, proved himself. I see someone who's earned his second chance but won't let himself take it."

He moved toward the door, paused with his hand on the knob.

"Best advice I can give you? Stop running. Sit still for five damn minutes and figure out what you actually want instead of what you're afraid of. Then choose that. Choose what you want, not what scares you less."

"And if I choose wrong?"

"Then you deal with the consequences and make another choice." Brennan opened the door. "That's called living, Alex. Might want to try it sometime."

He left, footsteps echoing down the wooden stairs.

I sat in my room alone, the duffel bag at my feet, Brennan's words echoing in my head.

Choose what you want, not what scares you less.

I wanted Katie. Wanted this life I was building. Wanted to believe I deserved it.

But wanting and believing were two different things.

I pulled the clothes out of the duffel bag slowly, hung them back in the closet. Not because I'd decided to stay. Not because I suddenly believed everything would work out.

But because Brennan was right about one thing: I needed to stop running long enough to figure out what I actually wanted.

And if I was honest—brutally, terrifyingly honest—what I wanted was exactly what I was running from.

Katie.

This life.

This chance to build something real.

The question was whether I had the courage to reach for it.

Or whether I'd spend the rest of my life running from the only thing I'd ever really wanted.

I didn't have the answer yet.

But at least I'd stopped packing.

That was something.
