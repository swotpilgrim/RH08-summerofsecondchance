# Chapter 10: The Dance

Saturday evening I stood in front of my mirror adjusting the new tie for the third time. The knot looked wrong. Everything looked wrong. I loosened it, started over, following Mr. Henderson's instructions. Loop, around, through. The face in the mirror was mine but unfamiliar—hair combed, clean-shaven, wearing a shirt that actually fit and made me look like someone who might belong at a town dance.

Six forty-five. Time to go.

I drove to Maple Street with hands tight on the steering wheel. The Sullivan house glowed with warm light. Through the window I could see movement—Katie getting ready, Beth hovering, Mike reading his newspaper. Normal Saturday evening for a family sending their daughter to a dance.

I climbed the porch steps and knocked.

Mike answered, dressed in slacks and button-up shirt like he'd made an effort for Katie's big night. His eyes assessed me—the new shirt, the nervous posture, the flowers I'd bought at the last minute from Mrs. Henderson's garden shop.

"Alex. Come in."

I stepped into the familiar living room. Beth sat on the couch watching with her usual suspicious expression. Katie appeared at the top of the stairs and my breath caught.

She wore a yellow summer dress with white flowers, hair down in soft waves, lipstick the color of roses. Beautiful. Not pretty-for-Meadowbrook beautiful. Just beautiful.

"Hi," Katie said, descending the stairs.

"Hi. You look—" I stopped. Every word felt inadequate. "Really nice."

"Thank you. So do you." Katie accepted the flowers with genuine pleasure. "These are perfect. Beth, can you put these in water?"

Beth took the flowers without comment, disappeared into the kitchen. Mike folded his newspaper, studied us with the expression of a father sending his daughter out with a boy he liked but didn't entirely trust yet.

"Have her home by eleven," Mike said.

"Yes, sir."

"Katie, you have fun. Dance. Be young." Mike kissed her forehead gently. "Your mother would be so happy to see you going to the dance again."

Katie's eyes brightened but she smiled. "I know, Dad."

Mike walked us to the door, clapped my shoulder in that Mike Sullivan way that conveyed both trust and warning. "Take care of her."

"I will."

We walked to the Ford. I opened the passenger door—Katie slid in, adjusted her dress. I climbed behind the wheel, started the engine. We drove toward the community hall in nervous silence.

"You okay?" Katie asked.

"Just thinking about the whole town watching us walk in together."

"Let them watch." Katie's voice was steady. "I want to be there with you. That's all that matters."

Meadowbrook Community Hall sat on the corner of Main and Fourth, a brick building that hosted everything from town meetings to wedding receptions. Tonight it glowed with strings of lights and bunting in red, white, and blue. Cars filled the parking lot—the whole town had turned out.

Inside, a big band played on the stage at the far end. Tables lined the walls covered with punch bowls and cookies. The dance floor filled the center, couples already moving to the music. Crepe paper decorations hung from the rafters. The hall smelled like perfume and summer heat and possibility.

Every head turned when we entered.

Katie took my arm naturally, like being seen with me in public was the most normal thing in the world. We found a spot along the wall. I tried not to notice the stares, the whispers, the way Mrs. Callahan assessed us from the refreshment table.

"Want to dance?" Katie asked.

"I don't really—"

"Come on. One dance." She pulled me toward the floor before I could protest.

The band was playing something slow and jazzy. Katie placed her hand on my shoulder, I took her other hand, positioned my free hand at her waist. Muscle memory kicked in—my mother teaching me to dance in our living room when I was fourteen, insisting every young man should know how to dance properly. I'd thought it was pointless then. Now I was grateful.

We moved across the floor in time with the music. Katie felt light in my arms, natural, like we'd done this a hundred times. People watched but Katie ignored them all, focused on me with that direct gaze that made everything else disappear.

"You're a good dancer," she said.

"My mother taught me. Before she got sick."

"She taught you well."

We danced through the song and into the next. The staring gradually diminished as people returned to their own partners, their own conversations. Maybe we weren't that interesting. Or maybe the town was giving Katie permission to be happy again.

"I'm glad we came," Katie said quietly.

"Yeah?"

"Yeah. I spent two years avoiding anything that reminded me of my mother. The dance, holidays, her favorite places. Like if I didn't participate in the things she loved, I wouldn't have to feel how much I missed her." Katie's voice was thoughtful. "But tonight I'm here dancing with you and I'm happy. Really happy. And I think she'd be glad about that."

I looked at Katie—her smile genuine, her eyes bright, her whole self more present than I'd ever seen her. And I realized I was happy too. Genuinely, completely happy for the first time since before my arrest. Maybe longer than that.

"I'm happy too," I admitted.

Katie's smile deepened. "Good."

We danced until my shirt stuck to my back from heat and my feet hurt from the unaccustomed dress shoes. We talked to townspeople who approached—Mrs. Callahan asking how the construction was going, Mr. Henderson nodding approval at the shirt he'd sold me, Tommy appearing with his date to make jokes about my dancing.

Near ten-thirty the band took a break. Katie fanned herself with her hand. "Want to walk? It's hot in here."

We stepped outside into summer night air. The heat had broken, leaving behind comfortable warmth and a sky full of stars. Katie suggested we walk toward Riverside Park—just a few blocks, she said, to cool off before I drove her home.

The park was empty at this hour. We found a bench overlooking the river. Fireflies drifted through darkness. The band music drifted faintly from the community hall. Katie sat beside me, close enough our shoulders touched.

"Thank you for tonight," she said.

"I didn't do anything. You asked me, remember?"

"You said yes. You showed up. You danced with me in front of the whole town even though I know it scared you." Katie turned to face me. "That took courage."

"Or stupidity."

"Courage." Katie's voice was firm. "I'm glad you came to Meadowbrook, Alex. I know the circumstances weren't ideal. But I'm glad you're here."

The honesty in her voice made my chest tight. "I'm glad too. I didn't think I would be. Month ago I was counting days until probation ended so I could leave. But now—"

"Now what?"

"Now I don't know if I want to leave. This job, the crew, your father teaching me the trade. It feels like maybe I could build something here. A real life, not just serving time."

"What about me?" Katie asked quietly. "Do I factor into your reasons for staying?"

The question hung between us under summer stars with fireflies and river sounds. I could deflect. Play it safe. Keep the walls up. Or I could be honest.

"Yeah. You factor in."

Katie leaned closer. "How?"

"Like maybe I deserve good things after all. Like maybe I'm more than my record. Like life could feel—" I stopped, searching for words. "Like this. Like right now. Like something worth staying for."

Katie's hand found mine, fingers intertwining. "That's all I wanted to hear."

She tilted her face toward mine. The moment stretched, heavy with possibility. I could see her eyes in starlight, feel her breath, sense the question she wasn't asking out loud. Permission. Invitation. Hope.

I wanted to kiss her. Wanted it so badly my hands shook. But terror rose up—what if I screwed this up? What if this was the moment everything fell apart? What if wanting her was the mistake that cost me everything?

I pulled back.

Katie didn't chase. Didn't push. Just squeezed my hand gently and smiled that understanding smile that said she wasn't going anywhere.

"It's okay," she said quietly.

"Katie—"

"It's okay, Alex. We have time."

We sat in silence watching fireflies and stars. Eventually Katie checked her watch. "It's almost eleven. My father will worry."

We walked back to the Ford, got in, drove to Maple Street. I walked Katie to her porch. She paused at the door, turned back.

"Thank you for tonight. I had a really good time."

"Me too."

"See you Monday?"

"Yeah. Monday."

Katie went inside. I stood on the porch for a moment watching the light in her window, thinking about the almost-kiss and my cowardice and how badly I wanted her despite knowing I had no business wanting Mike Sullivan's daughter.

I drove back to my room thinking about Katie's hand in mine and her face tilted toward me under stars. About pulling back when every cell in my body wanted to lean in. About being too afraid to take what was being offered.

I was falling for Katie Sullivan. Completely, terrifyingly, irreversibly falling for her. And there was no way this ended well—boss's daughter, ex-con on probation, whole town watching and waiting for me to prove I was exactly what they expected.

But I couldn't stop. Couldn't pull back. Couldn't protect myself from the inevitable disaster.

Because tonight on that bench with Katie's hand in mine, I'd felt something I'd thought was lost forever. Hope. Belonging. The possibility that maybe second chances were real and maybe I deserved one.

Even if wanting it scared me to death.

I hung up the new shirt and lay awake thinking about yellow dresses and fireflies and the moment I'd almost kissed Katie Sullivan but couldn't quite believe I deserved to.

Maybe tomorrow. Maybe Monday. Maybe when I was brave enough to take what she was offering without waiting for it to be taken away.

Maybe.
