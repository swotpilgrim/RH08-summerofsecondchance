# Chapter 3: Learning the Trade

Mike spread the blueprints across his truck hood Friday morning, corners weighted with hammers against the breeze. Clean lines and measurements, skeleton of houses waiting to take shape. I stood beside him trying to translate flat diagrams into three-dimensional walls.

"You read blueprints before?" Mike asked.

"Some. My uncle showed me the basics."

"Good. Then you know these numbers here"—he tapped the dimension markings—"tell you exactly how long each piece needs to be, what angles to cut, where everything fits. Construction isn't guessing. It's following the plan precisely."

I nodded, tracing the lines. Living room, kitchen, three bedrooms, bathroom. Simple ranch house layout repeated six times. Standard post-war housing for young families.

"This wall here." Mike pointed to an interior line. "Needs to be exactly sixteen feet, framed with studs every sixteen inches on center. You cut one stud wrong, the whole wall's compromised. Understand?"

"Yes, sir."

"Mike."

"Yes, Mike."

He rolled up the blueprints and handed them to me. "Study these during lunch. I want you to know this house inside and out by end of day. You're gonna help Tommy frame the master bedroom this afternoon."

The rolled paper felt significant in my hands. Mike was trusting me with the plans, expecting me to learn. In detention everything had been dictated—when to eat, when to sleep, when to move. Here I was expected to think, to contribute.

I took the blueprints to my workspace and got back to framing. Tommy was already deep into the exterior wall, movements efficient and practiced. He measured, marked, cut, nailed—steady rhythm from years of repetition. I watched his technique between my own cuts, noting how he checked square, tested each joint before nailing, worked methodically end to end.

"You gonna watch or work?" Tommy called without looking up.

"Both."

"Smart. Best way to learn is steal techniques from guys who know what they're doing." He set another stud. "Your uncle teach you to check square?"

"Yeah. Measure the diagonals—if they're equal, it's square."

"Good. Half the hacks skip that step, wonder why their doors don't hang right." Tommy moved to the next section. "Hand me that level."

I passed it over. He checked the vertical, adjusted a stud slightly, rechecked. Perfect plumb. The attention to detail reminded me of my uncle's insistence on precision.

"Why'd you get into construction?" I asked.

Tommy glanced at me, surprised. "My old man runs a garage. I grew up around tools and fixing things. When I turned eighteen I had a choice: work for him or try something different. Figured building houses beat changing oil." He nailed the stud home. "Why'd you?"

"Didn't exactly get into it. Just got assigned to it."

"Right. Probation." Tommy measured the next piece. "But you said your uncle did carpentry. You must've learned something before—" He stopped, seemed to recalibrate. "Before."

"Some. I liked it back then. Liked making things." I picked up a two-by-four, sighted down its length for straightness. "Never thought I'd do it for real, though."

"Why not?"

"Guess I didn't think I'd get the chance," I said finally.

Tommy hammered in three nails with quick precision. "Well, you got it now. Don't waste it."

The morning passed in steady work. Mike came by mid-morning, checked my cuts, tested my joints. He nodded approval and moved on. In detention, silence meant trouble. Here it meant you were doing fine.

At lunch I sat with blueprints spread across my lap, eating while studying the plans. The master bedroom was straightforward: twelve by fourteen feet, one window, door to hallway. I traced the lines until I could see the room in my head—walls rising, window framing the countryside.

Katie walked past carrying her clipboard and coffee, paused when she saw the blueprints.

"Studying?" she asked.

"Mike wants me to know the layout."

She sat down on the plywood stack beside me, examined the plans over my shoulder. "Master bedroom. This is a good design—big enough for a double bed and dressers, window placement gives nice morning light. My mother always said bedrooms should face east."

"Your mother designed houses?"

"No, but she had opinions about them." Katie's smile touched with grief. "She and my father built their house when I was little. She planned every detail, drove him crazy with changes. But she was right—the house works well."

"That's why you wanted to study architecture?"

Katie looked at me, surprised. "How'd you know that?"

I'd overheard her mention it to Mike, but admitting I'd been paying attention felt too revealing. "Just figured. You seem like you notice how buildings work."

"I do." She pointed to a wall junction on the blueprint. "See how this hallway connects to the living room? Creates good flow between spaces. Bad design would put the hallway off-center, make the living room feel cramped. Small choices matter in making a house feel like a home."

I'd never thought about houses that way. To me buildings were just structures, walls and roofs. Katie saw them as something more.

"You should design houses," I said.

"Maybe someday." Katie stood, brushed sawdust off her work pants. "For now I'll settle for making sure we have enough lumber to build someone else's designs." She tapped the blueprint. "Study hard. My father doesn't usually let new guys work on interior framing this early. He must think you're ready."

After lunch Tommy led me to the second house where the exterior walls were already up and the interior layout was marked on the subfloor. He handed me a stack of precut studs and pointed to the master bedroom outline.

"Sixteen-foot wall, studs every sixteen inches on center. Top plate, bottom plate, studs between. Show me what you learned."

This was a test. Tommy wanted to see if I could work independently. I laid out the bottom plate, measured and marked stud positions precisely: sixteen inches, thirty-two, forty-eight. Every measurement checked twice. Then I positioned the top plate parallel, marked it to match.

The work came back like muscle memory—my hands remembering what my mind had half-forgotten. My uncle's voice in my head: *Measure twice, cut once. Check square. Make sure it's plumb. Don't rush—rushed work is sloppy work.*

I built the wall frame on the floor, nailing each joint carefully. When it was complete I tested the diagonals. Equal. Square. I checked every stud for plumb. Perfect. Only then did I signal Tommy.

He walked over, framing square in hand, and examined my work without speaking. He checked the measurements, tested the joints, verified the square. I held my breath. This mattered more than it should—some guy's approval on a wall frame. But it did matter. It mattered because I wanted to be good at this, wanted to prove I could build something right.

"Not bad," Tommy said finally. "Let's get it raised."

Together we lifted the wall frame vertical, positioned it on the marked line, braced it. Tommy checked it with his level—plumb both directions—and nodded. We nailed it to the floor plate.

My first interior wall. Standing solid, square, ready for the life that would happen inside this room. Some family would sleep here, wake to that east-facing window. The thought made something tight in my chest loosen.

"You've done this before," Tommy said. It wasn't a question.

"With my uncle. Couple years ago."

"Shows. Your technique is solid—better than some guys I've worked with who've been in the trade for years." Tommy handed me the nail gun. "Frame the other bedroom walls. I'll check them when you're done."

He walked away, leaving me alone with the blueprint and a stack of lumber. Trust. Responsibility. The assumption I could do the work without supervision. I'd forgotten what that felt like.

I framed three more walls that afternoon, checking and rechecking every measurement, testing every joint, making sure each one was perfect. The physical work felt good—muscles burning, sweat dripping, hands busy with real purpose. This wasn't busywork or punishment. This was creation.

Near the end of the day Katie appeared in the doorway of the framed house, surveying the progress. She spotted me installing the last wall and crossed the rough floor, stepping carefully over tools and lumber.

"Tommy says you've been working solo all afternoon."

"He told me to frame the bedroom walls."

Katie examined my work with the same careful attention I'd seen her give supply deliveries and schedule coordination. She checked the plumb, tested a joint, measured a stud placement.

"This is good work, Alex. Precise. You triple-check everything?"

"Yes."

"Detention teach you that? Get it right the first time or face consequences?"

The observation was sharp but not cruel. I met her eyes. "Something like that."

"Well, you're not inside anymore." Katie's expression was serious. "Out here, second chances are what we're building. Mistakes happen and you fix them. Nobody's perfect, and perfection isn't the standard. The standard is honest work and learning from errors." She gestured at the walls around us. "But this—this is better than honest. This is skilled. Keep it up."

She left before I could respond, her words settling over me like a weight and a promise. *Second chances are what we're building.* Not just houses. Second chances. The opportunity to prove I was more than my worst mistake.

I gathered my tools as the sun dropped toward the horizon, muscles pleasantly sore, hands rough with sawdust and work. Mike did a final walkthrough, paused at my bedroom frames, said nothing but nodded approval. Tommy clapped my shoulder on his way to his truck.

"Same time Monday," he said. "We'll start on the next house."

I drove back to the boarding house in my rattling Ford, windows down, radio playing low. For the first time in eighteen months I felt something close to pride. Not the hollow pride of surviving another day in detention, but real pride in work well done. I'd built something today. Walls that would stand for decades. A bedroom where someone would sleep and wake and live.

Maybe Katie was right. Maybe second chances weren't about avoiding mistakes. Maybe they were about building something new, piece by piece, wall by wall, until you'd constructed a life worth living.

I could do that. I could build.
