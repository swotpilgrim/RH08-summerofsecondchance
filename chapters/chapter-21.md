# Chapter 21: The Cold Distance

I arrived at work Monday at seven sharp. Left at five on the dot. Kept my head down, my hands busy, my mouth shut. Spoke when spoken to about work. Ate lunch alone in my truck. Avoided Katie like my life depended on it.

Maybe it did.

Katie didn't push. Didn't corner me, didn't demand explanations, didn't try to talk. She showed up for deliveries, handled paperwork, checked schedules. Professional. Polite. Distant.

The distance hurt worse than anger would have.

I caught her watching me sometimes—when she thought I wasn't looking—and the expression on her face made my chest ache. Not anger. Just sadness. Disappointment.

Like I'd confirmed exactly what she'd accused me of.

The crew noticed immediately. Hard not to, when Katie and I had been spending every break together and now moved around each other like strangers.

Tuesday morning, Tommy cornered me by the lumber stack.

"What the hell are you doing?" he asked.

"Working. Same as you."

"Don't give me that." Tommy crossed his arms. "You and Katie were fine last week. Better than fine. Now you won't even look at her. What happened?"

"Nothing."

"Alex."

I set down the boards I'd been carrying. "It's complicated."

"Complicated how? You love her, she loves you, what's complicated about that?"

"Everything." I grabbed another board. "Just drop it, Tommy."

"No." He blocked my path. "I've kept my mouth shut for two weeks watching you two dance around each other. Now you've got what you wanted and you're throwing it away. So I'm asking: what the hell are you doing?"

"Staying out of her way," I said. "Before I mess everything up."

Tommy stared at me. "That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard."

"You don't understand—"

"I understand you're sabotaging the best thing that's happened to you because you're scared." Tommy's expression was disgusted. "Katie Sullivan—smart, beautiful, kind Katie who could have anyone—chose you. And you're running away."

"I'm being realistic."

"You're being a coward." Tommy stepped aside. "But hey, it's your life to waste."

He walked away, leaving me standing there with a two-by-four in my hands and shame burning in my gut.

Wednesday afternoon, Mike called me over to where he was checking the foundation work on house six.

"Walk with me," he said.

We walked to the edge of the development, where the houses gave way to farmland that hadn't been sold yet. Mike pulled out a cigarette, lit it, offered me one. I shook my head.

"Katie's mother didn't come from money," Mike said abruptly. "But her family had status. Respectability. Father was a banker, mother was on every church committee in Pittsburgh. When Ellen told them she was marrying a construction worker, they tried to talk her out of it."

I stayed quiet, sensing Mike needed to tell this story his way.

"They said she deserved better," Mike continued. "Said I'd never give her the life she was used to. That she'd end up struggling, having regrets. Her father even offered to pay for secretarial school if she'd break it off with me." He took a drag, exhaled smoke. "Know what Ellen did?"

"What?"

"Told them she'd rather struggle with someone she loved than live comfortably with regrets." Mike looked at me. "We didn't struggle much, as it turned out. Built a good business, raised two good daughters, had twenty-three happy years before the aneurysm took her. But the point is—Ellen chose the life she wanted instead of the one other people said she should have."

"That's different—"

"Is it?" Mike's gaze was sharp. "How?"

"You weren't fresh out of detention. Didn't have a record following you everywhere."

"No, but Ellen's family still thought she was making a mistake." Mike stubbed out his cigarette. "The question isn't whether people will judge Katie's choices. They will. Question is whether you have the courage to choose the life you actually want instead of the one you think you deserve."

The words hit too close to what Brennan had said.

"I don't want to hurt her," I said quietly.

"Then stop hurting her by pushing her away." Mike's tone gentled slightly. "Alex, I've watched you for nine months. Watched you show up early, work hard, fix your mistakes, learn new skills. You're not the same kid who got out of detention scared and defensive. You've grown. Changed."

"People don't change that much."

"They do if they work at it." Mike turned to face me fully. "I see the way you look at Katie. The way she looks at you. I know what that is. Ellen looked at me like that for twenty-three years, and I looked back the same way. That's rare. Special. And you're throwing it away because you're convinced you don't deserve it."

"Maybe I don't."

"Maybe that's not your decision to make." Mike's voice went firm. "Katie's smart enough to know what she wants. If she wanted safe and respectable, she'd have her pick. She wants you. Only question is whether you're brave enough to let her choose you."

I didn't know what to say to that.

Mike clapped me on the shoulder. "Think about it. But think fast. Katie's patient, but she's not a saint. You keep pushing her away, eventually she'll stay away."

He walked back toward the houses, leaving me standing at the edge of the development with his words echoing in my head.

Ellen chose the life she wanted instead of the one other people said she should have.

Brave enough to let her choose you.

Courage to choose the life you actually want.

Everyone kept saying the same thing in different ways. But knowing what I should do and having the guts to do it were two entirely different problems.

Thursday, I drove into town for lunch—needed to get away from the job site, from Katie's careful distance, from Tommy's disgusted looks and Mike's knowing silence.

Callahan's Diner was busy with the usual crowd. I slid into a corner booth and ordered coffee and a sandwich. Mrs. Callahan brought it herself instead of sending the waitress.

"Mind if I sit?" she asked.

Before I could answer, she slid into the opposite seat.

"You're looking rough," she observed.

"Long week."

"Long week because you're working yourself into the ground avoiding Katie Sullivan." Mrs. Callahan's tone was matter-of-fact. "Whole town's talking about it."

Of course they were. Small town, big gossip.

"Nothing to talk about," I muttered.

"Boy, I've been running this diner for thirty years. I know heartbreak when I see it, and you and Katie both look like you're dying inside." She poured herself coffee from my pot without asking. "So what happened?"

"It's complicated."

"It's always complicated." Mrs. Callahan added sugar to her cup. "Let me guess: you think you're not good enough for her. Think your record means you don't deserve happiness. So you're pushing her away before she figures out she can do better."

I stared at my sandwich, unable to deny it.

"Thought so." Mrs. Callahan sipped her coffee. "You're being a fool."

"So everyone keeps telling me."

"Then maybe you should listen." She set down her cup. "Katie's mother used to come in here every week. Ellen was special—saw the best in people, believed in second chances. She and Mike had their struggles early on, but they built something real. Something lasting."

"I know. Mike told me."

"Did he tell you what Ellen used to say about fear?" Mrs. Callahan's eyes were kind. "She said fear is just your brain trying to keep you safe, but sometimes safe isn't the same as happy. Sometimes you have to choose happy even when it scares you."

"And if it doesn't work out?"

"Then at least you tried." Mrs. Callahan stood up, patted my hand. "Regret from trying is easier to live with than regret from never having the guts to reach for what you wanted."

She left me alone with my sandwich and my thoughts.

All these people—Katie, Brennan, Tommy, Mike, Mrs. Callahan—saying the same thing. Telling me I was making the wrong choice. That I was letting fear win.

And the worst part was knowing they were right.

I was terrified. Terrified of staying, terrified of trying, terrified of believing I could have this. But I was also terrified of leaving. Of walking away from Katie, from this life, from the future I could have if I just had the courage to reach for it.

Fear either way.

But which fear could I live with?

I ate my sandwich without tasting it, paid Mrs. Callahan, and drove back to the job site.

Katie's truck was there. I could see her through the office trailer window, bent over paperwork, hair tucked behind her ear the way she did when she was concentrating.

My chest ached.

I loved her. Loved her enough that pushing her away was killing me. But was that enough? Was love enough to overcome my fear that I'd eventually disappoint her?

I didn't have the answer.

But I was starting to think the question itself was wrong.

Maybe it wasn't about whether love was enough.

Maybe it was about whether I had the courage to find out.
