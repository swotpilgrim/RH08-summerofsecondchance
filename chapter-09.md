# Chapter 9: The Dance Invitation

Tuesday morning Katie arrived at the site looking different. Not her appearance—same work clothes, same ponytail—but something in her expression. Determined. Like she'd made a decision.

The crew noticed too. Tommy gave me a look when Katie walked past carrying her clipboard with more purpose than supply schedules usually warranted.

"Summer dance is Saturday," she announced during the morning break. "The town sponsors it every year. Big band, dancing, the whole thing."

Ray perked up. "You going this year?"

"I'm thinking about it." Katie marked something on her clipboard without looking up. "Beth says everyone our age will be there."

The crew exchanged glances. Katie hadn't gone to the dance since her mother died. Everyone knew that. The summer dance had been Ellen Sullivan's favorite event—she'd organized it for years, made Mike dance with her even though he complained about his two left feet.

"That's good," Tommy said carefully. "Your mother would want you to go."

"I know." Katie's voice was quiet but steady. "That's what Beth said too. Time to start living again instead of just managing everyone else's lives."

Mike appeared from the framed house, coffee cup in hand. "What's this about the dance?"

"Katie's going," Ray said. "First time in two years."

Mike studied his daughter, expression unreadable. Then he nodded. "Good. You should go. Have fun. Be young." He sipped his coffee. "Your mother would be glad."

Katie's eyes brightened but she blinked it away. "It's just a dance."

"It's not just anything." Mike squeezed her shoulder gently and walked back to work.

The crew returned to framing. I picked up my hammer trying not to think about Katie at a dance. Dancing with someone. Some guy from town who had a clean record and a normal life. The thought made my chest tight.

I worked through lunch, measuring and cutting, keeping my hands busy so my mind wouldn't wander. But it wandered anyway. Katie in a dress. Music playing. Her smiling at someone who deserved her.

"You're going to wear out that saw blade."

Katie's voice startled me. I looked up to find her standing in the doorway of the framed bedroom, afternoon sun behind her creating a halo effect.

"Just trying to get this cut right."

"You've measured it three times. It's right." She crossed to where I was working, set down her clipboard. "Can I ask you something?"

"Sure."

Katie took a breath, met my eyes. "Will you go to the dance with me Saturday?"

The question hung in the sawdust-filled air. I'd been working up courage all day to ask her exactly that. But her asking me first changed everything. Made it real. Made it impossible to pretend this wasn't happening.

"Katie—"

"Before you say no, just listen." Her voice was steady but I could hear the nerves underneath. "I know it's complicated. You work for my father. The town gossips. You're still on probation. I know all the reasons this is a bad idea."

"Then why ask?"

"Because I want to go to the dance with you. Not with some nice boy from church or one of Tommy's cousins or whoever Beth tries to set me up with. I want to go with you."

Every instinct screamed to decline. Boss's daughter. Ex-con. The whole town watching and judging. But Katie was looking at me with those direct eyes that didn't leave room for deflection.

"People will talk," I said quietly. "Say things about you being with—someone like me."

"Let them talk. I don't care what people think."

"Your father—"

"My father likes you. Respects you. He's not going to object to me going to a dance with someone he hired."

"Katie, you deserve someone—"

"Don't." Her voice turned sharp. "Don't tell me what I deserve. I'm twenty years old and I've spent two years managing my father's business and raising my sister and putting my own life on hold. I get to decide what I want. And I want to go to this dance with you."

The honesty in her voice broke through my defenses. Katie wasn't asking out of pity or charity. She wanted this. Wanted me. The realization made something crack open in my chest—something that had been locked down since before detention.

"I want to," I admitted. "More than I've wanted anything in a long time."

"Then say yes."

I looked at Katie Sullivan standing in afternoon light surrounded by sawdust and framed walls, asking me to take her to a dance like I was someone worth being seen with in public. Like I was more than my record. Like I mattered.

"Yes."

Katie's smile was genuine and bright. "Good. Pick me up at seven. The dance starts at seven-thirty."

"I don't have—" I stopped. Didn't have nice clothes. Didn't have anything appropriate for taking the boss's daughter to a town dance.

"You don't have what?"

"Nothing. I'll figure it out."

Katie studied me, saw through the deflection. "There's a men's shop on Main Street. Mr. Henderson stocks decent shirts and ties. Tell him you're going to the dance—he'll help you out."

"I can handle it."

"I know you can." Katie picked up her clipboard. "Seven o'clock Saturday. Don't be late."

She walked away before I could second-guess or panic. I stood holding my saw in the empty bedroom trying to process what had just happened. Katie Sullivan had asked me to the dance. I'd said yes. In four days I'd be walking into Meadowbrook Community Hall with the girl the whole town had watched grow up, and every person there would know exactly who I was and where I'd been.

The thought terrified me.

But the thought of not going—of saying no to Katie and this chance—terrified me more.

That evening I drove to Main Street. Henderson's Men's Shop occupied a narrow storefront between the pharmacy and the hardware store. Bell chimed when I entered. The shop smelled like new fabric and starch.

An older man appeared from the back—Mr. Henderson, presumably. He looked me over with the assessing eye of someone who'd been fitting men for clothes for decades.

"Help you with something?"

"I need a shirt. Maybe a tie. For the dance Saturday."

His expression shifted—recognition, understanding. "You're Alex. Work for Mike Sullivan."

"Yes, sir."

"Mike's got good things to say about you. Says you're talented." Mr. Henderson gestured to a rack of shirts. "Dance is semi-formal. You'll want something nice but not fancy. What's your size?"

We spent twenty minutes finding a shirt that fit—light blue with white collar, crisp and new. Mr. Henderson selected a navy tie, showed me how to knot it properly in the shop's mirror. The man looking back at me in the reflection seemed like someone else. Someone who might belong at a town dance.

"That'll be four dollars for the shirt, dollar-fifty for the tie."

Five-fifty. Half a week's pay. But this was my paycheck—money I'd earned doing honest work, not stolen or conned or borrowed. I pulled out my wallet and paid in cash.

Mr. Henderson wrapped the shirt and tie in brown paper, handed them across the counter. "You're taking Katie Sullivan to the dance."

Not a question. Small town. Everyone knew everything.

"Yes, sir."

"Good for you. Good for her too. Katie's spent two years taking care of everyone else. Time someone took care of her for a change." He met my eyes. "Mike Sullivan's a good man. Don't give him reason to regret letting you work for him."

"I won't."

"See that you don't."

I carried the package to my truck thinking about Mr. Henderson's words and the weight of taking Mike's daughter to a public dance. The whole town would be watching. Judging. Waiting for me to prove I was exactly what they expected—the ex-con who didn't belong.

Thursday morning Officer Brennan showed up for his weekly check-in. I met him at the construction site during lunch break, lunch pail in hand.

"Alex." He flipped open his notebook. "How's the job?"

"Good. No problems."

"Staying out of trouble?"

"Yes, sir."

Brennan made notes, studying me with that cop assessment I'd learned to expect. But this time his expression held something else. Approval, maybe.

"You look different."

"Sir?"

"Lighter. Like you're not carrying the world on your shoulders waiting for it to collapse." He closed his notebook. "What changed?"

I thought about Katie and the crew and this job that had become more than just probation requirements. About Sunday dinners and cabinet measurements and saying yes to the dance.

"I don't know. Maybe I'm just settling in."

"Or maybe you're finally letting yourself belong somewhere." Brennan leaned against his patrol car. "I've been doing this job fifteen years. Most guys on probation are just counting days, following rules to avoid going back. But every once in a while someone actually changes. Uses their second chance for real."

"You think I'm doing that?"

"I think you've got a shot at it. Mike Sullivan says you're reliable. Tommy Ricci says the crew respects you. Town gossip says you're taking Katie Sullivan to the dance Saturday."

Of course he knew. Everyone knew.

"Is that a problem?"

"Only if you screw it up." Brennan's tone turned serious. "Katie's good people. Lost her mother, deferred her dreams, held her family together. She deserves to be happy. Whatever's happening between you two, don't hurt her. Understand?"

"I understand."

"Good." He climbed into his patrol car. "See you next week. Stay clean."

I watched him drive away thinking about his warning and Mr. Henderson's and Tommy's. Everyone in Meadowbrook seemed invested in protecting Katie Sullivan. And they were all giving me the same message: you can have this if you don't screw it up.

Saturday evening I hung the new shirt in my room and looked at it for a long time. Light blue fabric crisp and unwrinkled, navy tie laid beside it. First new clothes I'd bought with earned money in over a year. First date I'd had in longer than that. First time I'd let myself want something good without immediately talking myself out of it.

The shirt represented more than fabric and buttons. It represented choosing to stay. Choosing to belong. Choosing Katie and this town and a future I was terrified I didn't deserve but wanted desperately anyway.

I thought about Katie asking me to the dance with determination in her voice. About her saying she got to decide what she wanted. About choosing me despite everything.

For the first time since getting out of detention, I believed maybe I could keep the promises I'd made. Maybe I wouldn't screw this up. Maybe I could be the person Katie seemed to think I was.

Maybe second chances were real if you were brave enough to take them.
