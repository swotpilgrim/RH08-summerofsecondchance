# Chapter 13: Architecture Dreams

Mid-August evening I found Katie in the construction office sorting through filing cabinets. The crew had left hours ago. I'd stayed late working on cabinet installation, perfecting the joints until they were seamless. When I finished I'd seen her truck still parked outside.

"You're here late," I said from the doorway.

Katie looked up, brushed hair from her face. "Just organizing files. My father's system is creative but not exactly efficient."

"Need help?"

"Sure. If you don't mind filing."

I climbed the steps into the small office. Katie had papers spread across the desk—invoices, permits, contracts. The space felt intimate with just the two of us and evening light filtering through dusty windows.

"What are we filing?"

"Completed project records. Everything goes in chronological order." Katie handed me a stack of papers. "1955 goes in that cabinet, 1956 in the next one."

I started filing, falling into the methodical work. Katie worked beside me, close enough I could smell her shampoo, feel the warmth of proximity. We worked in comfortable silence.

A paper slipped from the 1955 stack and fluttered to the floor. I picked it up and froze. It was a letter on official University of Pennsylvania letterhead, addressed to Katherine Marie Sullivan.

*We are pleased to offer you admission to the School of Architecture with a full merit scholarship...*

"That's mine," Katie said quietly.

I handed it back. "Your acceptance letter."

"From two years ago. Found it this morning going through the files. Thought I'd thrown it away but apparently I just filed it with 1955 construction records." Katie stared at the letter, expression unreadable. "Seemed like a sign maybe. Universe telling me to deal with unfinished business."

"Have you thought about reapplying?"

"Sometimes. Late at night when I can't sleep I pull out my old sketches and imagine what I'd design if I had the training." Katie set down the letter, pulled a worn folder from her bag. "Want to see?"

"Yeah."

She opened the folder revealing pencil sketches on drafting paper. Buildings that fit into landscapes—low modern homes with big windows that brought the outside in, community centers with flowing spaces that encouraged gathering, libraries designed around natural light with reading nooks tucked into corners. One sketch showed a house built into a hillside, rooms stepping down the slope, roof gardens connecting to the landscape. Another depicted a small chapel with soaring ceilings and clerestory windows creating patterns of light across simple pews.

Each sketch showed real talent, understanding of proportion and flow and how spaces made people feel. These weren't amateur doodles. These were the work of someone with genuine architectural vision.

"Katie, these are incredible."

"They're just sketches. Dreams on paper."

"They're more than that." I picked up the hillside house design, studied the clean lines and thoughtful details. "This shows how you think about space and light and the way buildings should enhance life, not just contain it. This is what architects do. This is what you should be doing. Not filing permits for your father's construction business."

Katie took the sketches back, closed the folder carefully. "My father needs me."

"Does he? Or is that what you tell yourself so you don't have to face what you really want?"

The words came out sharper than intended. Katie's expression flickered—hurt and recognition.

"He does need me. After my mother died he could barely function. Without me managing the business side, Sullivan Construction would have failed."

"That was two years ago. He's better now. He runs the crew, makes decisions, functions fine." I leaned against the desk. "Couldn't he hire someone to do administrative work? Someone who actually wants to do that instead of someone sacrificing their dreams?"

"It's not that simple."

"Why not?"

Katie's hands tightened on the folder. "Because what if I leave and he falls apart again? What if Beth needs me and I'm not here? What if I've waited too long and wasted my chance? What if wanting something for myself makes me selfish?"

The fear in her voice mirrored my own. Katie was trapped not by her father's need but by her own guilt about wanting more.

"That's not selfish. That's living your life."

"That's rich coming from you." Katie's voice turned sharp. "You won't even let yourself want anything. You work twice as hard as necessary to prove yourself. You pull back every time we get close. You act like hoping for good things will guarantee losing them. And you're telling me I should pursue my dreams?"

The observation hit hard and accurate. Katie was right. I was lecturing her about fear while drowning in my own.

"You're right," I admitted. "I'm terrified of wanting things. Detention taught me that wanting makes you vulnerable. That caring about people means they can hurt you. That hope is dangerous."

"And you still believe that?"

"I'm trying not to." I looked at Katie standing in evening light holding her folder of architectural dreams. "You make me want to believe good things can last. That I can build a life here that won't fall apart. But I'm still afraid."

Katie set down the folder, crossed the small office until we stood close together. The space felt charged, heavy with everything unspoken between us.

"What are you afraid of specifically?"

"Everything. Disappointing your father. Screwing up probation. The town deciding I don't belong. Hurting you." I met her eyes. "Mostly hurting you."

"You haven't hurt me."

"Not yet."

"Alex." Katie's voice was gentle but firm. "You can't live your life terrified of potential hurt. My mother died suddenly and it destroyed us. But the twenty years we had with her were worth the pain of losing her. Loving people, caring about things, pursuing dreams—all of it involves risk. That's what makes it worth doing."

"What if I'm not brave enough?"

"You're brave enough. You stay late perfecting work that's already good because you care about craftsmanship. You went to the dance despite knowing the town would judge. You let yourself care about this job and this crew even though caring made you vulnerable." Katie's hand found mine. "You're already brave. You just don't believe it yet."

Her hand in mine felt right and terrifying. I looked at Katie Sullivan standing close enough to kiss, looking at me like I was someone worth believing in.

"I want things," I said quietly. "I want to get my contractor's license and run my own crew someday. I want to build houses that stand for fifty years. I want to belong in Meadowbrook instead of just passing through. I want your father to be proud of the work I do. I want—"

I stopped. The next words felt too big, too dangerous.

"What else do you want?" Katie's voice was barely above a whisper.

The truth sat on my tongue, terrifying and inevitable. I could deflect. Play it safe. Keep the walls up. But Katie had shown me her dreams, admitted her fears, been honest about being trapped. She deserved the same honesty.

"You. I want you."

The confession hung in the small office with evening light and filing cabinets and architecture sketches. Katie's eyes widened—surprise and recognition and something that looked like hope and want and fear all mixed together.

"Alex—"

She stepped closer, hand still in mine, her free hand coming up to rest against my chest. I could feel my heartbeat under her palm, racing and terrified. Katie looked at me like I'd just given her something precious.

"I want you too," she whispered. "I have for weeks. Maybe longer."

The admission made my breath catch. Katie wanted me. Not despite my record but because of who I was beyond it. The moment felt fragile and perfect and too good to be real.

The door banged open. Beth stood in the doorway, expression shifting from neutral to hostile when she saw Katie and me standing close together.

"Katie. Dad sent me to find you. Dinner's ready."

Katie stepped back, creating distance. "Thanks. I'll be home in a few minutes."

"Now, Katie. Dad's waiting." Beth's eyes fixed on me with open suspicion. "You should go home, Alex. It's late."

The hostility was clear. Beth saw me as a threat to her sister's safety, her family's stability. I couldn't entirely blame her.

"I was just leaving," I said.

"Good." Beth didn't move from the doorway, making it clear she was waiting for me to go.

Katie gathered her papers, avoiding my eyes. "See you tomorrow morning?"

"Yeah. Tomorrow."

I walked past Beth, down the office steps, to my truck. Beth watched until I drove away. In the rearview mirror I could see her standing with Katie in the office doorway, gesturing emphatically, clearly giving her sister a lecture about getting too close to the ex-con.

I drove to my room thinking about Katie's architecture sketches and my confession and Beth's protective fury. About wanting things and being afraid to reach for them and how Katie and I were both trapped by fear of different kinds.

Katie was afraid of being selfish. I was afraid of not deserving good things. Both of us stuck, both of us wanting more, both of us too scared to reach for it.

But I'd told her the truth. I wanted her. And she hadn't pulled away or said it was impossible or rejected me. She'd just looked at me with those eyes that saw past my record to who I actually was.

Maybe that was enough. Maybe tomorrow morning over coffee we'd figure out what came next. Maybe admitting what we wanted was the first step toward building something real.

I hung up my work clothes and lay awake thinking about Katie's hand in mine and the way she'd said my name before Beth interrupted. About architecture dreams deferred too long and second chances and being brave enough to want things even when wanting them scared you.

Tomorrow morning. Coffee on the office steps. Katie and me figuring out how to reach for what we wanted despite the fear.

I could do that. I could be brave enough for that.

Maybe.
