# Chapter 4: Callahan's Diner

"You coming to Callahan's or eating that sad sandwich again?" Tommy wiped sawdust off his hands Thursday at noon, second week on the job.

I glanced at my paper bag. Peanut butter and jelly, same as every day. "I'm good."

"Come on. My treat. Besides, the guys are starting to think you don't like them."

I didn't want charity, but Tommy's expression said this was about being part of the crew. In detention, separate had been safe. Out here, separate was just lonely.

"All right. Thanks."

We piled into Tommy's Chevy—him driving, me passenger, Ray in back discussing a horse race. Pete and Jim followed in Pete's Ford.

Callahan's Diner sat on Main and Second, brick building with green awning. Through the windows: red vinyl booths, chrome counter stools, exactly like every small-town diner. The kind of place where regulars had their tables and strangers got noticed.

The bell chimed when we entered. Coffee, frying burgers, something sweet. A dozen people filled the space. Everyone looked up. Some nodded at Tommy and the crew. Others fixed on me, assessing.

"Tommy Ricci!" A woman behind the counter called out, sixties with steel-gray hair and an apron. "Usual booth's open."

Tommy led us toward a corner booth. Mrs. Callahan intercepted us, sharp eyes landing on me. "Who's this?"

"Alex Brennan. New guy on Mike's crew." Tommy slid into the booth. "Alex, this is Mrs. Callahan. She runs the place and knows everything worth knowing in Meadowbrook."

"And plenty that isn't worth knowing." Mrs. Callahan extended her hand and I shook it—firm grip, cooler than her smile. "You're the one Mike hired from... the probation program."

Not a question. She knew. Of course she knew. In a town this size, everyone knew.

"Yes, ma'am."

"Well. Mike's a good judge of character." Her tone was polite but firm. Behave yourself. "Coffee?"

"Please."

"Burgers all around?" The crew nodded. "Coming right up."

I slid into the booth next to Ray. Being included felt strange and good and slightly terrifying.

"Don't mind Dorothy," Ray said quietly. "She's protective of the town. Sees herself as the gatekeeper of respectability."

"She knows about—"

"Everybody knows, kid. Small town." Ray shrugged. "Best thing you can do is show up, work hard, keep your nose clean. Eventually you'll just be Alex instead of 'that boy Mike hired.'"

The coffee arrived in heavy white mugs, strong and black. I added sugar and cream. The crew talked—Tommy's plans for poker Friday night, Pete's anniversary coming up, Jim's truck needing new brakes. Normal conversation, the kind of easy banter that came from working together long enough to know each other's lives.

The bell chimed and Katie walked in carrying her clipboard, hair pulled back in a ponytail and work shirt smudged with dirt. She scanned the diner, spotted our booth, and headed over.

"Scoot over." She gestured to Tommy, who slid closer to Pete to make room.

Katie settled in across from me, set her clipboard on the table, and immediately started reviewing delivery schedules. Mrs. Callahan appeared with coffee for her without being asked.

"The usual, Katie?"

"Please. Add it to my father's tab."

"Already done."

Katie looked up and smiled. "You finally came to Callahan's."

"Didn't want to intrude."

"Eating lunch isn't intruding." She made a note. "Supply delivery's late tomorrow. Alex, I'll need you to help unload. The specialty trim is heavy and I don't want Tommy throwing out his back again."

"I didn't throw out my back," Tommy protested. "I pulled a muscle. Different thing."

"You couldn't lift lumber for three days." Katie's expression was dry. "That's a thrown-out back in my book."

The crew laughed and Tommy grumbled good-naturedly. I sipped my coffee and watched the easy dynamic—Katie teasing Tommy, Ray adding a comment about age, Pete defending him. It was comfortable. Familiar. The kind of workplace family I'd never had.

The bell chimed again. A group of teenage girls entered, laughing and chattering, heading for a booth on the far side. One of them spotted Katie and waved. Katie waved back but stayed seated. The girl's gaze shifted to our booth, landed on me, and her expression hardened. She said something to her friends and they all looked over. Whispers started.

"That's my sister Beth," Katie said quietly. "Don't take it personally."

"She know about me?"

"Everyone knows about you. But Beth's protective. She lost our mother two years ago and she's convinced the world is full of people who'll hurt me if she's not vigilant." Katie's tone was matter-of-fact but carried an edge of frustration. "She'll come around."

I doubted it. Beth's eyes tracked me like I was a threat assessment she hadn't finished calculating. The hostile protective look of a younger sister watching out for family. I couldn't blame her. If I had a sister and some ex-con started working around her, I'd be suspicious too.

The burgers arrived—thick patties on toasted buns with lettuce, tomato, pickles, and fries on the side. Mine came with a side of coleslaw I didn't order. Mrs. Callahan set the plates down with efficient precision.

"Eat. You look too thin for construction work." She refilled coffee cups and moved on before I could respond.

Tommy grinned. "She's adopted you. That's her way of saying you're all right."

The burger was better than anything I'd eaten in eighteen months. Hot, juicy, properly seasoned. I ate slowly, making it last, listening to the crew's conversation shift to the weekend. Tommy was hosting poker—penny ante, nothing serious. Ray mentioned he'd placed a bet on Saturday's race at the track two counties over. Pete was taking his wife to dinner for their anniversary.

"What about you, Alex?" Ray asked. "Got plans for the weekend?"

"Work on the truck. Needs an oil change."

"Tommy's old man runs Ricci's Garage. He could do it for you."

"I can do it myself." The words came out sharper than intended. I softened my tone. "But thanks."

Katie glanced up from her fries. "You're staying at Mrs. Fletcher's boarding house, right? On Oak Street?"

"Yeah."

"How is it?"

"Fine. Roof doesn't leak."

Katie made a thoughtful noise. "There's a room above my father's office. Used to be storage. Has a bed, bathroom, kitchenette. Rent's cheaper than Fletcher's, closer to the site. Interested?"

The offer felt like charity. My jaw tightened.

"I'm good where I am."

"Oak Street to the site is twenty minutes each way. The office is five. You'd save on gas." Katie laid out facts. "Fletcher charges forty a month. The office room is thirty."

Ten dollars was two days' pay. But accepting felt like admitting I couldn't manage.

"I don't need charity."

Katie's eyes flashed. "It's not charity. It's a rental property my father owns that's sitting empty while you're paying more for less convenient housing. That's called a business transaction, not charity."

Mike's voice cut through the tension. "What's this about the office room?"

He'd appeared beside the booth, looking between Katie and me.

"I mentioned to Alex that the room above the office is available if he's interested," Katie said. "He seems to think it's charity."

Mike sipped his coffee. "Room's been empty six months. Thirty dollars covers utilities. It's practical, not charity. Your boarding house is across town, that truck drinks gas. Office room is five minutes from the site." He paused. "But it's your choice."

The crew watched. Katie had returned to her clipboard, body language tense.

This was about whether I'd accept help, whether I could be part of something. Refusing every kindness was just another kind of prison.

"I'll think about it," I said finally.

Mike nodded. "Fair enough. Offer stands when you decide."

The conversation shifted to work. I finished my burger. Katie's foot bumped mine under the table accidentally. She mouthed sorry. The brief contact shouldn't have meant anything. But it did.

By the time we paid—Tommy covered my lunch—I'd decided about the room. Staying at Mrs. Fletcher's meant keeping separate. The office room meant accepting I was part of Sullivan Construction now.

I caught Katie on the way to the parking lot.

"The room above the office," I said. "I'll take it. If it's still available."

Katie's smile was quick and genuine. "It's available. I'll help you move your stuff this weekend."

"You don't have to—"

"I know where the spare key is and you don't. I'm helping." She headed toward her truck, called back over her shoulder, "Saturday morning, nine AM. Don't be late."

I watched her drive away and realized I'd just agreed to spend Saturday with Katie Sullivan moving my meager belongings into a room I'd initially refused out of stubborn pride. Tommy clapped my shoulder as we walked to his Chevy.

"Smart choice. The office room's nicer than Fletcher's place, and Mrs. Callahan was right—you are too thin for construction work. Katie will probably stock the kitchenette with actual food."

"That's not—"

"It's exactly charity, but the good kind. The kind you accept because people care." Tommy started the engine. "You'll learn the difference eventually."

Maybe I would. Or maybe I'd spend the next eighteen months trying to figure out which kindnesses were genuine and which were pity. Either way, come Saturday I'd be moving into the room above Sullivan Construction's office, five minutes from the job site, with Katie Sullivan's help whether I wanted it or not.

Somehow that didn't bother me as much as it should have.
